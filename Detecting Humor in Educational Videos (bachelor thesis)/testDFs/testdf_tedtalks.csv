2,Quads have been around for a long time.,,True,bad,8.0,6170.0,0.0012949174490126255
3,They're so popular these days because they're mechanically simple.,,False,bad,,,
4,"By controlling the speeds of these four propellers, these machines can roll, pitch, yaw, and accelerate along their common orientation.",,False,bad,,,
5,"On board are also a battery, a computer, various sensors and wireless radios.",,False,bad,,,
6,"Quads are extremely agile, but this agility comes at a cost.",,False,bad,,,
7,"They are inherently unstable, and they need some form of automatic feedback control in order to be able to fly.",,False,bad,,,
8,"So, how did it just do that?",,False,bad,,,
9,Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop serve as an indoor global positioning system.,,False,bad,,,
10,It's used to locate objects in the space that have these reflective markers on them.,,False,bad,,,
11,"This data is then sent to another laptop that is running estimation and control algorithms, which in turn sends commands to the quad, which is also running estimation and control algorithms.",,False,bad,,,
12,The bulk of our research is algorithms.,,False,bad,,,
13,It's the magic that brings these machines to life.,,False,bad,,,
14,So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete?,,False,bad,,,
15,We use something broadly called model-based design.,,False,bad,,,
16,We first capture the physics with a mathematical model of how the machines behave.,,False,bad,,,
17,We then use a branch of mathematics called control theory to analyze these models and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them.,,False,bad,,,
18,"For example, that's how we can make the quad hover.",,False,bad,,,
19,We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations.,,False,bad,,,
20,We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory to create algorithms that stabilize the quad.,,False,bad,,,
21,Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach.,,False,bad,,,
22,Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover but to also balance this pole.,,False,bad,,,
23,"With a little bit of practice, it's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this, although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground and the use of our very versatile hands.",,False,bad,,,
24,It becomes a little bit more difficult when I only have one foot on the ground and when I don't use my hands.,,False,bad,,,
25,"Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top, which means that it can be located in the space.",,False,bad,,,
26,(Audience),,True,bad,,,
27,Oh!,,True,bad,,,
28,(Applause ends),,True,bad,,,
29,You can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments to keep the pole balanced.,,False,bad,,,
30,How did we design the algorithms to do this?,,False,bad,,,
31,We added the mathematical model of the pole to that of the quad.,,False,bad,,,
32,"Once we have a model of the combined quad-pole system, we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it.",,False,bad,,,
33,"Here, you see that it's stable, and even if I give it little nudges, it goes back - to the nice, balanced position.",,True,bad,,,
34,We can also augment the model to include where we want the quad to be in space.,,False,bad,,,
35,"Using this pointer, made out of reflective markers, I can point to where I want the quad to be in space a fixed distance away from me.",,True,bad,,,
36,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
37,"The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms, designed with the help of mathematical models and control theory.",,True,bad,,,
38,"Let's tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop, and I will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world.",,False,bad,,,
39,Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it.,,True,bad,,,
40,"Unlike the balancing pole, I did not include the mathematical model of the glass in the system.",,False,bad,,,
41,"In fact, the system doesn't even know that the glass is there.",,True,bad,,,
42,"Like before, I could use the pointer to tell the quad where I want it to be in space.",,True,bad,,,
43,(Applause ends),,True,bad,,,
44,"Okay, you should be asking yourself, why doesn't the water fall out of the glass?",,True,bad,,,
45,Two facts.,,False,bad,,,
46,The first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way.,,False,bad,,,
47,"The second is that the propellers are all pointing in the same direction of the glass, pointing up.",,False,bad,,,
48,"You put these two things together, the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects, which at these speeds are negligible.",,False,bad,,,
49,And that's why you don't need to model the glass.,,False,bad,,,
50,"It naturally doesn't spill, no matter what the quad does.",,True,bad,,,
51,(Audience),,True,bad,,,
52,Oh!,,True,bad,,,
53,(Applause ends),,True,bad,,,
54,"The lesson here is that some high-performance tasks are easier than others, and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard.",,False,bad,,,
55,"In this instance, carrying a glass of water is easy.",,False,bad,,,
56,Balancing a pole is hard.,,True,bad,,,
57,We've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured.,,False,bad,,,
58,Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage?,,False,bad,,,
59,"Conventional wisdom says that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly, because there are four degrees of freedom to control: roll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.",,False,bad,,,
60,"Hexacopters and octocopters, with six and eight propellers, can provide redundancy, but quadrocopters are much more popular because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs: four.",,False,bad,,,
61,Or do they?,,True,bad,,,
62,(Audience),,True,bad,,,
63,Oh!,,True,bad,,,
64,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
65,"If we analyze the mathematical model of this machine with only two working propellers, we discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it.",,False,bad,,,
66,"We relinquish control of yaw, but roll, pitch and acceleration can still be controlled with algorithms that exploit this new configuration.",,False,bad,,,
67,Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible.,,False,bad,,,
68,"In this instance, this knowledge allows us to design novel machine architectures or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage, just like human athletes do, instead of building machines with redundancy.",,False,bad,,,
69,"We can't help but hold our breath when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water, or when a vaulter is twisting in the air, the ground fast approaching.",,False,bad,,,
70,Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry?,,False,bad,,,
71,Will the vaulter stick the landing?,,True,bad,,,
72,Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip and finish off at the exact same spot that it started.,,False,bad,,,
73,This maneuver is going to happen so quickly that we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution.,,True,bad,,,
74,There simply isn't enough time.,,False,bad,,,
75,"Instead, what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly, observe how it finishes the maneuver, and then use that information to modify its behavior so that the next flip is better.",,True,bad,,,
76,"Similar to the diver and the vaulter, it is only through repeated practice that the maneuver can be learned and executed to the highest standard.",,True,bad,,,
77,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
78,Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports.,,False,bad,,,
79,How do we make a machine do what an athlete does seemingly without effort?,,False,bad,,,
80,(Laughter)  (Applause ends),,True,bad,,,
81,"This quad has a racket strapped onto its head with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple, so not too large.",,True,bad,,,
82,"The following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds, or 50 times per second.",,False,bad,,,
83,We first figure out where the ball is going.,,False,bad,,,
84,We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball so that it flies to where it was thrown from.,,True,bad,,,
85,"Third, a trajectory is planned that carries the quad from its current state to the impact point with the ball.",,False,bad,,,
86,"Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds' worth of that strategy.",,True,bad,,,
87,"Twenty milliseconds later, the whole process is repeated until the quad strikes the ball.",,True,bad,,,
88,"Machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own, they can do it collectively.",,False,bad,,,
89,These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net.,,False,bad,,,
90,(Applause ends),,True,bad,,,
91,They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver to launch the ball back to me.,,True,bad,,,
92,"Notice that, at full extension, these quads are vertical.",,False,bad,,,
93,"In fact, when fully extended, this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels at the end of their launch.",,True,bad,,,
94,The algorithms to do this are very similar to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me.,,True,bad,,,
95,Mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan a cooperative strategy 50 times per second.,,False,bad,,,
96,Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities.,,False,bad,,,
97,What happens when we couple this machine athleticism with that of a human being?,,True,bad,,,
98,What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor mainly used in gaming.,,True,bad,,,
99,It can recognize what my various body parts are doing in real time.,,False,bad,,,
100,"Similar to the pointer that I used earlier, we can use this as inputs to the system.",,False,bad,,,
101,We now have a natural way of interacting with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures.,,False,bad,,,
102,Interaction doesn't have to be virtual.,,False,bad,,,
103,It can be physical.,,False,bad,,,
104,"Take this quad, for example.",,False,bad,,,
105,It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.,,False,bad,,,
106,"If I try to move it out of the way, it fights me, and moves back to where it wants to be.",,False,bad,,,
107,"We can change this behavior, however.",,False,bad,,,
108,We can use mathematical models to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad.,,False,bad,,,
109,"Once we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics, as far as the quad is concerned, of course.",,True,bad,,,
110,"Here, the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid.",,False,bad,,,
111,We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine.,,False,bad,,,
112,I will use this new capability to position this camera-carrying quad to the appropriate location for filming the remainder of this demonstration.,,True,bad,,,
113,So we can physically interact with these quads and we can change the laws of physics.,,False,bad,,,
114,Let's have a little bit of fun with this.,,True,bad,,,
115,"For what you will see next, these quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto.",,True,bad,,,
116,"As time goes on, gravity will be increased until we're all back on planet Earth, but I assure you we won't get there.",,True,bad,,,
117,"Okay, here goes.",,True,bad,,,
118,(Laughter) (Laughter),,True,bad,,,
119,Whew!,1.0,True,good,,,
120,"You're all thinking now, these guys are having way too much fun, and you're probably also asking yourself, why exactly are they building machine athletes?",,True,bad,,,
121,Some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom is to hone skills and develop capabilities.,,False,bad,,,
122,"Others think that it has more of a social role, that it's used to bind the group.",,False,bad,,,
123,"Similarly, we use the analogy of sports and athleticism to create new algorithms for machines to push them to their limits.",,False,bad,,,
124,What impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life?,,False,bad,,,
125,"Like all our past creations and innovations, they may be used to improve the human condition or they may be misused and abused.",,False,bad,,,
126,This is not a technical choice we are faced with; it's a social one.,,False,bad,,,
127,"Let's make the right choice, the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines, just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us.",,False,bad,,,
128,Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain.,,True,bad,,,

146,But she taught me: you can't let those differences define you.,,False,bad,,,
147,"Being able to reimagine yourself beyond what other people see, that is the toughest task of all, but it's also the most beautiful.",,False,bad,,,
148,"You see, we all come to this world in a body.",,False,bad,,,
149,"People with physical or neurological difficulties, environmentally impacted communities, immigrants, boys, girls, boys who want to dress as girls, girls with veils, women who have been sexually assaulted, athletes who bend their knee as a sign of protest, black, white, Asian, Native American, my sister, you, or me.",,False,bad,,,
150,We all want what everyone wants: to dream and to achieve.,,False,bad,,,
151,"But sometimes, society tells us, and we tell ourselves, we don't fit the mold.",,False,bad,,,
152,"Well, if you look at my story, from being born somewhere different, to belly dancing in high school, to telling stories you wouldn't normally see on TV, what makes me different is what has made me stand out and be successful.",,False,bad,,,
153,"I have traveled the world, and talked to people from all walks of life.",,False,bad,,,
154,You know what I've learned?,,True,bad,,,
155,The single thing every one of us has in common is being human.,,False,bad,,,

160,"I also encourage you to be curious and ask, ""What is on other people's pieces of paper?""",,False,bad,,,
161,"""What makes them different?""",,False,bad,,,
162,Let's celebrate those imperfections that make us special.,,False,bad,,,
163,"I hope that it teaches you that nobody has a claim on the word ""normal.""",,True,bad,,,
164,We are all different.,,False,bad,,,

166,Thank you so much.,,False,bad,,,
0,"First, a video.",,False,bad,,,
1,"Yes, it is a scrambled egg.",,True,bad,,,
2,"But as you look at it, I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy.",,False,bad,,,
3,Because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is unscrambling itself.,,True,bad,,,
4,And you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated.,,False,bad,,,
5,And now they're going to be poured back into the egg.,,True,bad,,,
6,And we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works.,,False,bad,,,
7,A scrambled egg is mush - tasty mush - but it's mush.,1.0,True,good,,,
8,"An egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things, such as chickens.",,True,bad,,,
9,And we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity.,,False,bad,,,
10,"In fact, this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics, the second law of thermodynamics, or the law of entropy.",,False,bad,,,
11,"What that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order, lack of structure - in fact, to mush.",,True,bad,,,
12,And that's why that video feels a bit strange.,,True,bad,,,
13,"And yet, look around us.",,False,bad,,,
14,What we see around us is staggering complexity.,,False,bad,,,
15,"Eric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone, there are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded.",,False,bad,,,
16,That's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth.,,False,bad,,,
17,"And they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals, who are linked by trade, travel, and the Internet into a global system of stupendous complexity.",,False,bad,,,
18,"So here's a great puzzle: in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics, how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described, the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center?",,True,bad,,,
19,"Well, the answer seems to be, the universe can create complexity, but with great difficulty.",,False,bad,,,
20,"In pockets, there appear what my colleague, Fred Spier, calls ""Goldilocks conditions"" - not too hot, not too cold, just right for the creation of complexity.",,False,bad,,,
21,And slightly more complex things appear.,,False,bad,,,
22,"And where you have slightly more complex things, you can get slightly more complex things.",,False,bad,,,
23,"And in this way, complexity builds stage by stage.",,False,bad,,,
24,Each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe.,,False,bad,,,
25,We refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments.,,False,bad,,,
26,"And at each threshold, the going gets tougher.",,False,bad,,,
27,"The complex things get more fragile, more vulnerable; the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent, and it's more difficult to create complexity.",,False,bad,,,
28,"Now, we, as extremely complex creatures, desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law, and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility.",,False,bad,,,
29,And that's the story that we tell in big history.,,False,bad,,,
30,"But to do it, you have do something that may, at first sight, seem completely impossible.",,False,bad,,,
31,You have to survey the whole history of the universe.,,False,bad,,,
32,So let's do it.,,False,bad,,,
33,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
34,"Let's begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years, to the beginning of time.",,False,bad,,,
35,"Around us, there's nothing.",,False,bad,,,
36,There's not even time or space.,,False,bad,,,
37,"Imagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are.",,False,bad,,,
38,"And then suddenly, bang!",,False,bad,,,
39,"A universe appears, an entire universe.",,False,bad,,,
40,And we've crossed our first threshold.,,False,bad,,,
41,The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.,,False,bad,,,
42,It's incredibly hot.,,False,bad,,,
43,"It contains everything that's in today's universe, so you can imagine, it's busting.",,True,bad,,,
44,And it's expanding at incredible speed.,,False,bad,,,
45,"And at first, it's just a blur, but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur.",,False,bad,,,
46,"Within the first second, energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity.",,False,bad,,,
47,And energy does something else quite magical: it congeals to form matter - quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons.,,False,bad,,,
48,And all of that happens in the first second.,,True,bad,,,
49,"Now we move forward 380,000 years.",,False,bad,,,
50,That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet.,,False,bad,,,
51,And now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium.,,False,bad,,,
52,"Now I want to pause for a moment, 380,000 years after the origins of the universe, because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage.",,False,bad,,,
53,We know above all that it was extremely simple.,,False,bad,,,
54,"It consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms, and they have no structure.",,False,bad,,,
55,They're really a sort of cosmic mush.,,True,bad,,,
56,But that's not completely true.,,False,bad,,,
57,"Recent studies by satellites such as the WMAP satellite have shown that, in fact, there are just tiny differences in that background.",,False,bad,,,
58,"What you see here, the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas.",,False,bad,,,
59,"These are tiny differences, but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity.",,False,bad,,,
60,And this is how it works.,,True,bad,,,
61,Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff.,,False,bad,,,
62,"So where you get slightly denser areas, gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms.",,False,bad,,,
63,So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds.,,False,bad,,,
64,"And each cloud is compacted, gravity gets more powerful as density increases, the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud, and then, at the center, the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees, protons start to fuse, there's a huge release of energy, and - bam!",,True,bad,,,
65,We have our first stars.,,False,bad,,,
66,"From about 200 million years after the Big Bang, stars begin to appear all through the universe, billions of them.",,False,bad,,,
67,And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex.,,False,bad,,,
68,Stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing two new thresholds.,,False,bad,,,
69,"When very large stars die, they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations, to form all the elements of the periodic table.",,False,bad,,,
70,"If, like me, you're wearing a gold ring, it was forged in a supernova explosion.",,True,bad,,,
71,So now the universe is chemically more complex.,,False,bad,,,
72,"And in a chemically more complex universe, it's possible to make more things.",,False,bad,,,
73,"And what starts happening is that, around young suns, young stars, all these elements combine, they swirl around, the energy of the star stirs them around, they form particles, they form snowflakes, they form little dust motes, they form rocks, they form asteroids, and eventually, they form planets and moons.",,False,bad,,,
74,"And that is how our solar system was formed, four and a half billion years ago.",,False,bad,,,
75,Rocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials.,,False,bad,,,
76,So we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity.,,False,bad,,,
77,"Now, the going gets tougher.",,False,bad,,,
78,"The next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile, significantly more vulnerable, but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity.",,False,bad,,,
79,"I'm talking, of course, about living organisms.",,False,bad,,,
80,Living organisms are created by chemistry.,,False,bad,,,
81,We are huge packages of chemicals.,,False,bad,,,
82,"So, chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force.",,False,bad,,,
83,"That operates over smaller scales than gravity, which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets.",,True,bad,,,
84,"Now, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry?",,False,bad,,,
85,What are the Goldilocks conditions?,,True,bad,,,
86,"Well, first, you need energy, but not too much.",,False,bad,,,
87,"In the center of a star, there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again.",,False,bad,,,
88,But not too little.,,False,bad,,,
89,"In intergalactic space, there's so little energy that atoms can't combine.",,False,bad,,,
90,"What you want is just the right amount, and planets, it turns out, are just right, because they're close to stars, but not too close.",,False,bad,,,
91,"You also need a great diversity of chemical elements, and you need liquids, such as water.",,False,bad,,,
92,Why?,,False,bad,,,
93,"Well, in gases, atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up.",,False,bad,,,
94,"In solids, atoms are stuck together, they can't move.",,False,bad,,,
95,"In liquids, they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules.",,False,bad,,,
96,"Now, where do you find such Goldilocks conditions?",,True,bad,,,
97,"Well, planets are great, and our early Earth was almost perfect.",,False,bad,,,
98,It was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water.,,False,bad,,,
99,"And deep beneath those oceans, at cracks in the Earth's crust, you've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth, and you've got a great diversity of elements.",,False,bad,,,
100,"So at those deep oceanic vents, fantastic chemistry began to happen, and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations.",,False,bad,,,
101,"But of course, life is more than just exotic chemistry.",,False,bad,,,
102,How do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable?,,False,bad,,,
103,"Well, it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick.",,False,bad,,,
104,"You don't stabilize the individual; you stabilize the template, the thing that carries information, and you allow the template to copy itself.",,False,bad,,,
105,"And DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecule that contains that information.",,False,bad,,,
106,You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA.,,False,bad,,,
107,Each rung contains information.,,False,bad,,,
108,"So, DNA contains information about how to make living organisms.",,False,bad,,,
109,And DNA also copies itself.,,False,bad,,,
110,"So, it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean.",,False,bad,,,
111,So the information spreads.,,False,bad,,,
112,Notice that information has become part of our story.,,False,bad,,,
113,The real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections.,,False,bad,,,
114,"As it copies itself, once in every billion rungs, there tends to be an error.",,False,bad,,,
115,"And what that means is that DNA is, in effect, learning.",,False,bad,,,
116,It's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work.,,False,bad,,,
117,So DNA's learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity.,,False,bad,,,
118,And we can see this happening over the last four billion years.,,False,bad,,,
119,"For most of that time of life on Earth, living organisms have been relatively simple - single cells.",,False,bad,,,
120,"But they had great diversity, and, inside, great complexity.",,False,bad,,,
121,"Then from about 600 to 800 million years ago, multi-celled organisms appear.",,False,bad,,,
122,"You get fungi, you get fish, you get plants, you get amphibia, you get reptiles, and then, of course, you get the dinosaurs.",,False,bad,,,
123,"And occasionally, there are disasters.",,False,bad,,,
124,"Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid landed on Earth near the Yucatan Peninsula, creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war, and the dinosaurs were wiped out.",,False,bad,,,
125,"Terrible news for the dinosaurs, but great news for our mammalian ancestors, who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.",,False,bad,,,
126,And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid.,,False,bad,,,
127,"Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.",,False,bad,,,
128,And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story.,,False,bad,,,
129,Let me explain why.,,False,bad,,,
130,"We've seen that DNA learns in a sense, it accumulates information.",,False,bad,,,
131,But it is so slow.,,False,bad,,,
132,"DNA accumulates information through random errors, some of which just happen to work.",,False,bad,,,
133,"But DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning: it had produced organisms with brains, and those organisms can learn in real time.",,False,bad,,,
134,"They accumulate information, they learn.",,False,bad,,,
135,"The sad thing is, when they die, the information dies with them.",,False,bad,,,
136,Now what makes humans different is human language.,,False,bad,,,
137,"We are blessed with a language, a system of communication, so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory.",,False,bad,,,
138,"And that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information, and it can accumulate from generation to generation.",,False,bad,,,
139,"And that's why, as a species, we're so creative and so powerful, and that's why we have a history.",,False,bad,,,
140,We seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift.,,False,bad,,,
141,I call this ability collective learning.,,False,bad,,,
142,It's what makes us different.,,False,bad,,,
143,We can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history.,,False,bad,,,
144,"We evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa, but then you see humans migrating into new environments, into desert lands, into jungles, into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia - tough, tough environment - into the Americas, into Australasia.",,False,bad,,,
145,"Each migration involved learning - learning new ways of exploiting the environment, new ways of dealing with their surroundings.",,False,bad,,,
146,"Then 10,000 years ago, exploiting a sudden change in global climate with the end of the last ice age, humans learned to farm.",,False,bad,,,
147,Farming was an energy bonanza.,,False,bad,,,
148,"And exploiting that energy, human populations multiplied.",,False,bad,,,
149,"Human societies got larger, denser, more interconnected.",,False,bad,,,
150,"And then from about 500 years ago, humans began to link up globally through shipping, through trains, through telegraph, through the Internet, until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals.",,False,bad,,,
151,And that brain is learning at warp speed.,,False,bad,,,
152,"And in the last 200 years, something else has happened.",,False,bad,,,
153,We've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels.,,False,bad,,,
154,So fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us.,,False,bad,,,
155,So -,,True,bad,,,
156,"Here we are, back at the convention center.",,False,bad,,,
157,"We've been on a journey, a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.",,False,bad,,,
158,I hope you agree this is a powerful story.,,False,bad,,,
159,And it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role.,,False,bad,,,
160,But it also contains warnings.,,True,bad,,,
161,"Collective learning is a very, very powerful force, and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it.",,False,bad,,,
162,"I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England, living through the Cuban Missile Crisis.",,False,bad,,,
163,"For a few days, the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction.",,False,bad,,,
164,"And the same weapons are still here, and they are still armed.",,False,bad,,,
165,"If we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us.",,False,bad,,,
166,"We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years.",,False,bad,,,
167,"So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us, but it can also show us our power with collective learning.",,False,bad,,,
168,"And now, finally - this is what I want.",,False,bad,,,
169,"I want my grandson, Daniel, and his friends and his generation, throughout the world, to know the story of big history, and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us.",,False,bad,,,
170,"And that's why a group of us are building a free, online syllabus in big history for high-school students throughout the world.",,False,bad,,,
171,"We believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them, as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet.",,False,bad,,,
172,I thank you for your attention.,,False,bad,,,
0,"Well, we all need a reason to wake up.",,False,bad,,,
1,"For me, it just took 11,000 volts.",,False,bad,,,
2,"I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you.",,True,bad,,,
3,"One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train.",,True,bad,,,
4,"It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead.",,False,bad,,,
5,"Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time.",,True,bad,,,
6,We'd certainly done stupider things.,,False,bad,,,
7,"I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet, and that was that.",,True,bad,,,
8,Would you believe that watch still works?,,True,bad,,,
9,Takes a licking!,,True,bad,,,
10,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
11,My father wears it now in solidarity.,,True,bad,,,
12,That night began my formal relationship with death - my death - and it also began my long run as a patient.,,False,bad,,,
13,It's a good word.,,True,bad,,,
14,It means one who suffers.,,False,bad,,,
15,So I guess we're all patients.,,True,bad,,,
16,"Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction - to match its brilliance, to be sure.",,False,bad,,,
17,"I'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides.",,False,bad,,,
18,"And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well - I mean, truly.",,False,bad,,,
19,But we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve.,,False,bad,,,
20,Why?,,False,bad,,,
21,"Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center.",,False,bad,,,
22,"Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed.",,True,bad,,,
23,"And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilled and concentrated.",,False,bad,,,
24,There are no do-overs.,,True,bad,,,
25,My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation.,,False,bad,,,
26,"That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying.",,False,bad,,,
27,"We have a monumental opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die.",,False,bad,,,
28,So let's begin at the end.,,False,bad,,,
29,"For most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering.",,False,bad,,,
30,It's a key distinction.,,False,bad,,,
31,"To get underneath this, it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change.",,False,bad,,,
32,"The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow.",,False,bad,,,
33,It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves.,,False,bad,,,
34,"They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing.",,True,bad,,,
35,"After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example, became fact, fixed - necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself.",,False,bad,,,
36,"It took me a while, but I learned it eventually.",,False,bad,,,
37,"Now, another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver - human beings.",,False,bad,,,
38,"This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens.",,False,bad,,,
39,"Yes, compassion - literally, as we learned yesterday - suffering together.",,False,bad,,,
40,"Now, on the systems side, on the other hand, so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented.",,False,bad,,,
41,It serves no good purpose.,,True,bad,,,
42,"But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it.",,False,bad,,,
43,How we die is indeed something we can affect.,,False,bad,,,
44,Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day.,,True,bad,,,
45,"After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care, is to relieve suffering - not add to the pile.",,True,bad,,,
46,"True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician.",,True,bad,,,
47,"Quick aside: palliative care - a very important field but poorly understood - while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care.",,False,bad,,,
48,It is not limited to hospice.,,False,bad,,,
49,It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage.,,False,bad,,,
50,So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care.,,False,bad,,,
51,"Now, let me introduce you to Frank.",,False,bad,,,
52,Sort of makes this point.,,True,bad,,,
53,I've been seeing Frank now for years.,,False,bad,,,
54,He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV.,,False,bad,,,
55,"We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life - really, about our lives.",,False,bad,,,
56,"In this way, Frank grieves.",,False,bad,,,
57,"In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in the next moment.",,False,bad,,,
58,"Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another.",,False,bad,,,
59,Frank has always been an adventurer - he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting - and no fan of regret.,,True,bad,,,
60,"So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River.",,True,bad,,,
61,Was this a good idea?,,True,bad,,,
62,"With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no.",,False,bad,,,
63,"Many did, but he went for it, while he still could.",,False,bad,,,
64,"It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon - all the glorious side of the world beyond our control.",,False,bad,,,
65,"Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind so many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time.",,False,bad,,,
66,So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective.,,False,bad,,,
67,"After my accident, when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history.",,False,bad,,,
68,"Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see - a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing.",,False,bad,,,
69,"Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower.",,False,bad,,,
70,"Flash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective.",,False,bad,,,
71,"When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause.",,True,bad,,,
72,"Anyone who wants - fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now - shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body with flower petals.",,True,bad,,,
73,"It takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance.",,False,bad,,,
74,"Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting, much like this - floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has.",,False,bad,,,
75,"Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person had never really existed.",,False,bad,,,
76,"Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness - anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic.",,True,bad,,,
77,I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them.,,False,bad,,,
78,But we ask too much of our hospitals.,,False,bad,,,
79,They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness.,,False,bad,,,
80,They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for.,,False,bad,,,
81,Now mind you - I am not giving up on the notion that our institutions can become more humane.,,False,bad,,,

13,"But it is your self-diagnosed boringness and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist, really fascinated by you.",,True,bad,,,

16,They spell out the acronym OCEAN.,,True,bad,,,

32,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
33,Those are the extroverts.,,True,bad,,,
34,"Let me deal in a bit more detail with extroversion, because it's consequential and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand what I call our three natures.",,False,bad,,,
35,"First, our biogenic nature - our neurophysiology.",,False,bad,,,

37,"And third, what makes you individually you - idiosyncratic - what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature.",,False,bad,,,
38,Let me explain.,,False,bad,,,
39,One of the things that characterizes extroverts is they need stimulation.,,True,bad,,,
40,"And that stimulation can be achieved by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties and social events here at TED - you see the extroverts forming a magnetic core.",,True,bad,,,
41,They all gather together.,,False,bad,,,
42,And I've seen you.,,False,bad,,,
43,"The introverts are more likely to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able to reduce stimulation - and may be misconstrued as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial.",,True,bad,,,
44,It may be that you simply realize that you do better when you have a chance to lower that level of stimulation.,,False,bad,,,
45,"Sometimes it's an internal stimulant, from your body.",,False,bad,,,
46,"Caffeine, for example, works much better with extroverts than it does introverts.",,True,bad,,,

48,"Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks they're engaged in - and they've had some coffee - if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance of not being particularly quantitative.",,True,bad,,,
49,But it's a misconstrual.,,True,bad,,,
50,"So here are the consequences that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point.",,False,bad,,,
51,"I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time.",,True,bad,,,
52,"And so, if you would like me to - yes, you would?",,True,bad,,,

75,"Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to.",,True,bad,,,
76,We speak differently.,,False,bad,,,
77,"Extroverts prefer black-and-white, concrete, simple language.",,True,bad,,,

98,"Well, I'll tell you what Tom said in a minute.",,False,bad,,,
99,"He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese.""",,True,bad,,,
100,"And here is how extroverted ears heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate.",,True,bad,,,
101,"I said, ""Well Michael does have a tendency at times of behaving in a way that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive than is normally called for.""",,True,bad,,,
102,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
103,"Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter)  Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain ""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word.",,True,bad,,,
104,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
105,"But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks like one, I call him one.""",,True,bad,,,
106,And we go past each other.,,False,bad,,,

108,Of course.,,True,bad,,,
109,It's important that we know this.,,False,bad,,,

117,That make us love you?,,False,bad,,,
118,Not just because you're a certain type of person.,,False,bad,,,
119,I'm uncomfortable putting people in pigeonholes.,,False,bad,,,
120,I don't even think pigeons belong in pigeonholes.,,True,bad,,,
121,So what is it that makes us different?,,False,bad,,,
122,It's the doings that we have in our life - the personal projects.,,False,bad,,,
123,"You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here.",,True,bad,,,
124,"It relates to your kid - you've been back three times to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong.",,False,bad,,,

127,These are free traits.,,False,bad,,,
128,"You're very agreeable, but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something for your mom or your child.",,True,bad,,,

131,And they are what matters.,,False,bad,,,
132,"Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core projects in your life?""",,False,bad,,,

138,"And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement to keep them going in arduous days of study.",,False,bad,,,

193,And the reason I think is this: that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education.,,False,bad,,,

195,"It won't, and it never did.",,False,bad,,,

206,They have certain common features.,,False,bad,,,
207,They're very personalized.,,False,bad,,,
208,"They have strong support for the teachers, close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum, and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school.",,False,bad,,,

229,"Right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions to come about, and with organic systems, if the conditions are right, life is inevitable.",,False,bad,,,
230,It happens all the time.,,False,bad,,,
231,"You take an area, a school, a district, you change the conditions, give people a different sense of possibility, a different set of expectations, a broader range of opportunities, you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners, you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do, and schools that were once bereft spring to life.",,False,bad,,,
232,Great leaders know that.,,False,bad,,,
233,"The real role of leadership in education - and I think it's true at the national level, the state level, at the school level - is not and should not be command and control.",,False,bad,,,

239,"And if we can encourage more people, that will be a movement.",,False,bad,,,
240,"And if the movement is strong enough, that's, in the best sense of the word, a revolution.",,False,bad,,,
241,And that's what we need.,,False,bad,,,
242,Thank you very much.,,False,bad,,,
243,Thank you very much.,,False,bad,,,
0,Thank you very much.,,False,bad,,,
1,"Well, I would like to start with testicles.",,True,bad,,,
2,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
3,Men who sleep five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more.,,True,bad,,,
4,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
5,"In addition, men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior.",,True,bad,,,
6,So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade in terms of that critical aspect of wellness.,,False,bad,,,
7,And we see equivalent impairments in female reproductive health caused by a lack of sleep.,,False,bad,,,
8,This is the best news that I have for you today.,,False,bad,,,
9,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
10,"From this point, it may only get worse.",,True,bad,,,
11,"Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep, but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough, both for your brain and for your body.",,False,bad,,,
12,"Let me start with the brain and the functions of learning and memory, because what we've discovered over the past 10 or so years is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit the save button on those new memories so that you don't forget.",,False,bad,,,
13,"But recently, we discovered that you also need sleep before learning to actually prepare your brain, almost like a dry sponge ready to initially soak up new information.",,False,bad,,,
14,"And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain essentially become waterlogged, as it were, and you can't absorb new memories.",,False,bad,,,
15,So let me show you the data.,,False,bad,,,
16,"Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea.",,True,bad,,,
17,So we took a group of individuals and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups: a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group.,,False,bad,,,
18,"Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber, but the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake in the laboratory, under full supervision.",,False,bad,,,
19,"There's no naps or caffeine, by the way, so it's miserable for everyone involved.",,True,bad,,,
20,"And then the next day, we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts as we're taking snapshots of brain activity.",,False,bad,,,
21,And then we're going to test them to see how effective that learning has been.,,False,bad,,,
22,And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis.,,False,bad,,,
23,"And when you put those two groups head to head, what you find is a quite significant, 40-percent deficit in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep.",,False,bad,,,
24,"I think this should be concerning, considering what we know is happening to sleep in our education populations right now.",,True,bad,,,
25,"In fact, to put that in context, it would be the difference in a child acing an exam versus failing it miserably - 40 percent.",,True,bad,,,
26,And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain to produce these types of learning disabilities.,,False,bad,,,
27,"And there's a structure that sits on the left and the right side of your brain, called the hippocampus.",,False,bad,,,
28,And you can think of the hippocampus almost like the informational inbox of your brain.,,False,bad,,,
29,It's very good at receiving new memory files and then holding on to them.,,False,bad,,,
30,"And when you look at this structure in those people who'd had a full night of sleep, we saw lots of healthy learning-related activity.",,False,bad,,,
31,"Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived, we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever.",,False,bad,,,
32,"So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox, and any new incoming files - they were just being bounced.",,True,bad,,,
33,You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory.,,False,bad,,,
34,"So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you, but let me just come back to that control group for a second.",,False,bad,,,
35,Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep?,,True,bad,,,
36,"Well, we can ask a very different question:",,False,bad,,,
37,What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep when you do get it that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability each and every day?,,False,bad,,,
38,"And by placing electrodes all over the head, what we've discovered is that there are big, powerful brainwaves that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep that have riding on top of them these spectacular bursts of electrical activity that we call sleep spindles.",,False,bad,,,
39,"And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night, shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain, and therefore protecting them, making them safe.",,False,bad,,,
40,"And it is important that we understand what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits, because there are real medical and societal implications.",,False,bad,,,
41,"And let me just tell you about one area that we've moved this work out into, clinically, which is the context of aging and dementia.",,False,bad,,,
42,"Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older, our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline.",,False,bad,,,
43,"But what we've also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse, especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing.",,False,bad,,,
44,"And only last year, we finally published evidence that these two things, they're not simply co-occurring, they are significantly interrelated.",,False,bad,,,
45,"And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep is an underappreciated factor that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline in aging, and most recently we've discovered, in Alzheimer's disease as well.",,False,bad,,,
46,"Now, I know this is remarkably depressing news.",,True,bad,,,
47,It's in the mail.,,False,bad,,,
48,It's coming at you.,,False,bad,,,
49,But there's a potential silver lining here.,,False,bad,,,
50,"Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging, for example changes in the physical structure of the brain, that's fiendishly difficult to treat.",,False,bad,,,
51,But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting because we may be able to do something about it.,,False,bad,,,
52,"And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center is not by using sleeping pills, by the way.",,True,bad,,,
53,"Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep.",,True,bad,,,
54,"Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this.",,False,bad,,,
55,It's called direct current brain stimulation.,,False,bad,,,
56,"You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain, so small you typically don't feel it, but it has a measurable impact.",,False,bad,,,
57,"Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young, healthy adults, as if you're sort of singing in time with those deep-sleep brainwaves, not only can you amplify the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves, but in doing so, we can almost double the amount of memory benefit that you get from sleep.",,False,bad,,,
58,"The question now is whether we can translate this same affordable, potentially portable piece of technology into older adults and those with dementia.",,False,bad,,,
59,"Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep, and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning and memory function?",,False,bad,,,
60,That is my real hope now.,,False,bad,,,
61,"That's one of our moon-shot goals, as it were.",,True,bad,,,
62,"So that's an example of sleep for your brain, but sleep is just as essential for your body.",,False,bad,,,
63,We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system.,,True,bad,,,
64,"Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system, and that all it takes is one hour.",,True,bad,,,
65,"Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called daylight saving time.",,False,bad,,,
66,"Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day.",,False,bad,,,
67,"In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep, we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks.",,False,bad,,,
68,Isn't that incredible?,,False,bad,,,
69,"And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents, even suicide rates.",,False,bad,,,
70,"But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this: sleep loss and your immune system.",,False,bad,,,
71,"And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image.",,False,bad,,,
72,"They are called natural killer cells, and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents of your immune system.",,False,bad,,,
73,"They are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements and eliminating them.",,False,bad,,,
74,"In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.",,False,bad,,,
75,"So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins at all times, and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough.",,False,bad,,,
76,"So here in this experiment, you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night, you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours for one single night, and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction in immune cell activity that you suffer.",,False,bad,,,
77,"And it's not small - it's not 10 percent, it's not 20 percent.",,False,bad,,,
78,There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity.,,False,bad,,,
79,"That's a concerning state of immune deficiency, and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding significant links between short sleep duration and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer.",,False,bad,,,
80,"Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast.",,False,bad,,,
81,"In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong that the World Health Organization has classified any form of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen, because of a disruption of your sleep-wake rhythms.",,False,bad,,,
82,So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when you're dead.,,True,bad,,,
83,"Well, I'm being quite serious now - it is mortally unwise advice.",,True,bad,,,
84,We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals.,,False,bad,,,
85,"There's a simple truth: the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.",,True,bad,,,
86,Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.,,False,bad,,,
87,"And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer or even Alzheimer's disease were not sufficiently disquieting, we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself, your DNA genetic code.",,False,bad,,,
88,"So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night for one week, and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night.",,False,bad,,,
89,And there were two critical findings.,,False,bad,,,
90,"First, a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity, caused by a lack of sleep.",,False,bad,,,
91,The second result was that about half of those genes were actually increased in their activity.,,False,bad,,,
92,The other half were decreased.,,False,bad,,,
93,"Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep were genes associated with your immune system, so once again, you can see that immune deficiency.",,False,bad,,,
94,"In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated or increased by way of a lack of sleep, were genes associated with the promotion of tumors, genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body, and genes associated with stress, and, as a consequence, cardiovascular disease.",,False,bad,,,

103,"Let's take the largest number on the board here, 8649.",,False,bad,,,
104,Would you each enter that on your calculator?,,True,bad,,,
105,"And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me what you're multiplying by - just multiply it by any random three-digit number.",,False,bad,,,

199,"(Laughter) Good, thank you very much.",,False,bad,,,
200,(Applause ends),,True,bad,,,
201,But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation.,,False,bad,,,
202,There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.,,True,bad,,,
203,"Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?",,True,bad,,,
204,"OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are.",,False,bad,,,
205,"You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?",,True,bad,,,
206,"OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator.",,False,bad,,,
207,"But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem thinking out loud.",,False,bad,,,
208,"So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size.",,True,bad,,,
209,"Now, I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green.",,False,bad,,,
210,"I know as a magician we're not supposed to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week, so - I think we're OK.",,True,bad,,,
211,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,

224,Let me explain to you how I'm going to attempt this problem.,,False,bad,,,
225,I'm going to break the problem down into three parts.,,False,bad,,,
226,"I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two.",,True,bad,,,
227,"Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer.",,False,bad,,,

230,Thank you.,,False,bad,,,

233,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
234,"While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers, creep into the calculation.",,False,bad,,,
235,Let me explain what that is.,,False,bad,,,
236,"This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert numbers into words.",,False,bad,,,
237,"I store them as words, and later on retrieve them as numbers.",,False,bad,,,
238,I know it sounds complicated; it's not.,,False,bad,,,

243,"If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then.",,True,bad,,,
244,"By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators - you know who you are - there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here.",,True,bad,,,
245,"If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is; just say, ""you're close,"" or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer - which could be pretty entertaining in itself.",,True,bad,,,
246,"If, however, I am right, whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?",,True,bad,,,
247,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
248,"Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK.",,True,bad,,,
249,"So, without any more stalling, here we go.",,True,bad,,,
250,"I'll start the problem in the middle, with 57 times 683.",,True,bad,,,
251,"57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931.",,True,bad,,,
252,"38,931; double that to get 77,862.",,True,bad,,,
253,"77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822.",,True,bad,,,
254,"That seems right, I'll go on.",,False,bad,,,
255,"Cookie fission, OK.",,True,bad,,,
256,"Next, I do 57 squared, which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion.",,True,bad,,,
257,"Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming - 249 - add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million - fission, fission, OK, finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee - 328,489.",,True,bad,,,
258,Audience: Yeah!,,True,bad,,,

0,"Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life, I ceased to exist.",,False,bad,,,
1,"I was having a small operation, and my brain was filling with anesthetic.",,False,bad,,,
2,I remember a sense of detachment and falling apart and a coldness.,,False,bad,,,
3,"And then I was back, drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there.",,False,bad,,,
4,"Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now.",,False,bad,,,

6,"I could have been under for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years.",,True,bad,,,
7,I simply wasn't there.,,False,bad,,,
8,It was total oblivion.,,False,bad,,,
9,Anesthesia - it's a modern kind of magic.,,False,bad,,,
10,"It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people.",,True,bad,,,
11,And in this process is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy.,,False,bad,,,
12,How does consciousness happen?,,False,bad,,,
13,"Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience.",,False,bad,,,
14,And not just any conscious experience - your conscious experience right here and right now.,,False,bad,,,
15,How does this happen?,,False,bad,,,
16,Answering this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is.,,False,bad,,,
17,"Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all.",,False,bad,,,
18,"And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through mental illness or pain.",,False,bad,,,
19,"And if we can experience joy and suffering, what about other animals?",,False,bad,,,
20,"Might they be conscious, too?",,True,bad,,,
21,Do they also have a sense of self?,,False,bad,,,
22,"And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point, maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops a sense of its own existence.",,True,bad,,,
23,I actually think the prospects for a conscious AI are pretty remote.,,True,bad,,,
24,And I think this because my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms.,,False,bad,,,
25,Consciousness and intelligence are very different things.,,False,bad,,,
26,"You don't have to be smart to suffer, but you probably do have to be alive.",,False,bad,,,
27,"In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through and because of our living bodies.",,False,bad,,,
28,"Now, you might have heard that we know nothing about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness.",,False,bad,,,
29,Some people even say it's beyond the reach of science altogether.,,False,bad,,,
30,"But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area.",,False,bad,,,
31,"If you come to my lab at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers.",,False,bad,,,
32,All of us together trying to understand how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong.,,False,bad,,,
33,And the strategy is very simple.,,False,bad,,,
34,I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've come to think about life.,,False,bad,,,
35,"At one time, people thought the property of being alive could not be explained by physics and chemistry - that life had to be more than just mechanism.",,False,bad,,,
36,But people no longer think that.,,False,bad,,,
37,"As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry - things like metabolism, reproduction, homeostasis - the basic mystery of what life is started to fade away, and people didn't propose any more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital.",,False,bad,,,
38,"So as with life, so with consciousness.",,False,bad,,,
39,"Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is should start to fade away.",,False,bad,,,
40,At least that's the plan.,,True,bad,,,
41,So let's get started.,,False,bad,,,
42,What are the properties of consciousness?,,False,bad,,,
43,What should a science of consciousness try to explain?,,False,bad,,,
44,"Well, for today I'd just like to think of consciousness in two different ways.",,False,bad,,,
45,"There are experiences of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic, 3D, fully immersive inner movie.",,False,bad,,,
46,And then there's conscious self.,,False,bad,,,
47,The specific experience of being you or being me.,,True,bad,,,
48,"The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness we all cling to most tightly.",,False,bad,,,
49,"Let's start with experiences of the world around us, and with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine.",,False,bad,,,
50,Imagine being a brain.,,False,bad,,,
51,"You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure what's out there in the world.",,False,bad,,,
52,There's no lights inside the skull.,,False,bad,,,
53,There's no sound either.,,False,bad,,,
54,"All you've got to go on is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related to things in the world, whatever they may be.",,False,bad,,,
55,So perception - figuring out what's there - has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs about the way the world is to form its best guess of what caused those signals.,,False,bad,,,
56,The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.,,False,bad,,,
57,What we perceive is its best guess of what's out there in the world.,,False,bad,,,
58,Let me give you a couple of examples of all this.,,False,bad,,,
59,"You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think about it in a new way.",,False,bad,,,
60,"If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be very different shades of gray, right?",,True,bad,,,
61,But they are in fact exactly the same shade.,,False,bad,,,
62,And I can illustrate this.,,False,bad,,,
63,"If I put up a second version of the image here and join the two patches with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference.",,False,bad,,,
64,It's exactly the same shade of gray.,,False,bad,,,
65,"And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across and join them up.",,True,bad,,,
66,"It's a single colored block of gray, there's no difference at all.",,False,bad,,,
67,This isn't any kind of magic trick.,,True,bad,,,
68,"It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again, and it looks different.",,True,bad,,,
69,"So what's happening here is that the brain is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter than it really is.",,False,bad,,,
70,"Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience.",,False,bad,,,
71,Have a listen to this.,,False,bad,,,
72,(Distorted voice),,False,bad,,,
73,"Sounded strange, right?",,True,bad,,,
74,Have a listen again and see if you can get anything.,,False,bad,,,
75,(Distorted voice) Still strange.,,True,bad,,,
76,Now listen to this.,,False,bad,,,
77,(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit is a really terrible idea.,,True,bad,,,
78,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
79,Which I do.,,True,bad,,,
80,"So you heard some words there, right?",,True,bad,,,
81,Now listen to the first sound again.,,False,bad,,,
82,I'm just going to replay it.,,True,bad,,,
83,(Distorted voice),,False,bad,,,
84,Yeah?,,True,bad,,,
85,So you can now hear words there.,,False,bad,,,
86,Once more for luck.,,True,bad,,,
87,(Distorted voice),,False,bad,,,
88,"OK, so what's going on here?",,True,bad,,,
89,The remarkable thing is the sensory information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all.,,False,bad,,,
90,All that's changed is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information.,,False,bad,,,
91,And that changes what you consciously hear.,,False,bad,,,
92,All this puts the brain basis of perception in a bit of a different light.,,False,bad,,,
93,"Instead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions flowing in the opposite direction.",,False,bad,,,
94,"We don't just passively perceive the world, we actively generate it.",,False,bad,,,
95,"The world we experience comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in.",,False,bad,,,
96,"Let me give you one more example of perception as this active, constructive process.",,False,bad,,,
97,Here we've combined immersive virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience.,,False,bad,,,
98,"In this panoramic video, we've transformed the world - which is in this case Sussex campus - into a psychedelic playground.",,True,bad,,,
99,We've processed the footage using an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions.,,True,bad,,,
100,"In this case, to see dogs.",,True,bad,,,
101,And you can see this is a very strange thing.,,False,bad,,,
102,"When perceptual predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis.",,False,bad,,,
103,"Now, think about this for a minute.",,False,bad,,,
104,"If hallucination is a kind of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions are being reined in by sensory information from the world.",,False,bad,,,
105,"In fact, we're all hallucinating all the time, including right now.",,True,bad,,,
106,"It's just that when we agree about our hallucinations, we call that reality.",,True,bad,,,
107,"(Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain.",,False,bad,,,
108,"This seems a very strange idea, right?",,True,bad,,,
109,"Yes, visual illusions might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived about what it means to be me?",,False,bad,,,
110,"For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified and so continuous that it's difficult not to take it for granted.",,False,bad,,,
111,But we shouldn't take it for granted.,,False,bad,,,
112,There are in fact many different ways we experience being a self.,,False,bad,,,
113,There's the experience of having a body and of being a body.,,False,bad,,,
114,There are experiences of perceiving the world from a first person point of view.,,False,bad,,,
115,There are experiences of intending to do things and of being the cause of things that happen in the world.,,False,bad,,,
116,"And there are experiences of being a continuous and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set of memories and social interactions.",,False,bad,,,
117,"Many experiments show, and psychiatrists and neurologists know very well, that these different ways in which we experience being a self can all come apart.",,False,bad,,,
118,What this means is the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain.,,False,bad,,,
119,"Another experience, which just like all others, requires explanation.",,False,bad,,,
120,So let's return to the bodily self.,,False,bad,,,
121,How does the brain generate the experience of being a body and of having a body?,,False,bad,,,
122,"Well, just the same principles apply.",,False,bad,,,
123,The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not part of its body.,,False,bad,,,
124,And there's a beautiful experiment in neuroscience to illustrate this.,,False,bad,,,
125,"And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home.",,True,bad,,,
126,All you need is one of these.,,True,bad,,,
127,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
128,And a couple of paintbrushes.,,True,bad,,,
129,"In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand is placed in front of them.",,True,bad,,,
130,Then both hands are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand.,,True,bad,,,
131,"Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand is in fact part of their body.",,True,bad,,,
132,"And the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess that the fake hand is in fact part of the body.",,True,bad,,,
133,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
134,So you can measure all kinds of clever things.,,False,bad,,,
135,"You can measure skin conductance and startle responses, but there's no need.",,False,bad,,,
136,It's clear the guy in blue has assimilated the fake hand.,,True,bad,,,
137,This means that even experiences of what our body is is a kind of best guessing - a kind of controlled hallucination by the brain.,,False,bad,,,
138,There's one more thing.,,False,bad,,,
139,"We don't just experience our bodies as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within.",,False,bad,,,
140,We all experience the sense of being a body from the inside.,,False,bad,,,
141,"And sensory signals coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing, what the blood pressure is like, lots of things.",,False,bad,,,
142,"This kind of perception, which we call interoception, is rather overlooked.",,False,bad,,,
143,"But it's critically important because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body - well, that's what keeps us alive.",,False,bad,,,
144,Here's another version of the rubber hand illusion.,,True,bad,,,
145,This is from our lab at Sussex.,,False,bad,,,
146,"And here, people see a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time with their heartbeat.",,False,bad,,,
147,"And when it's flashing in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense that it's in fact part of their body.",,False,bad,,,
148,So experiences of having a body are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within.,,False,bad,,,
149,"There's one last thing I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us.",,False,bad,,,
150,"When I look around me, the world seems full of objects - tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot - even my own body in the world, I can perceive it as an object from the outside.",,False,bad,,,
151,"But my experiences of the body from within, they're not like that at all.",,False,bad,,,
152,"I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ...",,False,bad,,,
153,"I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere.",,False,bad,,,
154,I don't perceive my insides as objects.,,False,bad,,,
155,"In fact, I don't experience them much at all unless they go wrong.",,False,bad,,,
156,"And this is important, I think.",,False,bad,,,
157,"Perception of the internal state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation - keeping the physiological variables within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival.",,False,bad,,,
158,"When the brain uses predictions to figure out what's there, we perceive objects as the causes of sensations.",,False,bad,,,
159,"When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things, we experience how well or how badly that control is going.",,False,bad,,,
160,"So our most basic experiences of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.",,False,bad,,,
161,"And when we follow this idea all the way through, we can start to see that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic drive to stay alive.",,False,bad,,,
162,"We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of our living bodies.",,False,bad,,,
163,Let me bring things together step-by-step.,,False,bad,,,
164,What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess of what's out there.,,False,bad,,,
165,"Our experienced world comes from the inside out, not just the outside in.",,False,bad,,,
166,The rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body.,,False,bad,,,
167,And these self-related predictions depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body.,,False,bad,,,
168,"And finally, experiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there.",,False,bad,,,
169,"So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it - well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity.",,False,bad,,,
170,We predict ourselves into existence.,,False,bad,,,
171,"Now, I leave you with three implications of all this.",,False,bad,,,
172,"First, just as we can misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms of prediction go wrong.",,False,bad,,,
173,"Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like depression and schizophrenia.",,False,bad,,,
174,"Second: what it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated.",,False,bad,,,
175,"We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.",,False,bad,,,
176,Just making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient.,,False,bad,,,
177,"Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible way of being conscious.",,False,bad,,,
178,And even human consciousness generally - it's just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses.,,False,bad,,,
179,"Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures.",,False,bad,,,
180,"Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science, from Copernicus - we're not at the center of the universe - to Darwin - we're related to all other creatures - to the present day.",,False,bad,,,
181,"With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of and not apart from the rest of nature.",,False,bad,,,
182,"And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of.",,True,bad,,,
183,Nothing at all.,,True,bad,,,
184,Thank you.,,False,bad,,,
0,"I was here four years ago, and I remember, at the time, that the talks weren't put online.",,True,bad,,,
1,"I think they were given to TEDsters in a box, a box set of DVDs, which they put on their shelves, where they are now.",,True,bad,,,
2,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
3,"And actually, Chris called me a week after I'd given my talk, and said, ""We're going to start putting them online.",,False,bad,,,
4,"Can we put yours online?""",,True,bad,,,
5,"And I said, ""Sure.""",,True,bad,,,
6,"And four years later, it's been downloaded four million times.",,True,bad,,,
7,So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who've seen it.,,True,bad,,,
8,"And, as Chris says, there is a hunger for videos of me.",,True,bad,,,

10,Don't you feel?,,False,bad,,,

12,"So, this whole event has been an elaborate build-up to me doing another one for you, so here it is.",,True,bad,,,
13,(Laughter) Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis.,,True,bad,,,
14,And I referenced that at the end of my last talk.,,False,bad,,,
15,"So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes, frankly.",,True,bad,,,
16,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
17,"So, as I was saying - (Laughter)",,True,bad,,,
18,"You see, he's right.",,False,bad,,,
19,"I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously, and I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more.",,True,bad,,,
20,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
21,"But I believe there is a second climate crisis, which is as severe, which has the same origins, and that we have to deal with with the same urgency.",,False,bad,,,
22,"And you may say, by the way, ""Look, I'm good.",,True,bad,,,
23,"I have one climate crisis, I don't really need the second one.""",,True,bad,,,
24,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
25,"But this is a crisis of, not natural resources - though I believe that's true - but a crisis of human resources.",,False,bad,,,
26,"I believe fundamentally, as many speakers have said during the past few days, that we make very poor use of our talents.",,False,bad,,,
27,"Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be, or if they have any to speak of.",,False,bad,,,
28,I meet all kinds of people who don't think they're really good at anything.,,False,bad,,,
29,"Actually, I kind of divide the world into two groups now.",,False,bad,,,
30,"Jeremy Bentham, the great utilitarian philosopher, once spiked this argument.",,True,bad,,,
31,"He said, ""There are two types of people in this world: those who divide the world into two types and those who do not.""",,False,bad,,,
32,"(Laughter) Well, I do.",,True,bad,,,
33,(Laughter) I meet all kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do.,,False,bad,,,
34,They simply go through their lives getting on with it.,,False,bad,,,
35,They get no great pleasure from what they do.,,False,bad,,,
36,"They endure it rather than enjoy it, and wait for the weekend.",,True,bad,,,
37,But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine doing anything else.,,False,bad,,,
38,"If you said, ""Don't do this anymore,"" they'd wonder what you're talking about.",,False,bad,,,
39,"It isn't what they do, it's who they are.",,False,bad,,,
40,"They say, ""But this is me, you know.",,True,bad,,,
41,"It would be foolish to abandon this, because it speaks to my most authentic self.""",,False,bad,,,
42,And it's not true of enough people.,,False,bad,,,
43,"In fact, on the contrary, I think it's still true of a minority of people.",,False,bad,,,
44,And I think there are many possible explanations for it.,,False,bad,,,
45,"And high among them is education, because education, in a way, dislocates very many people from their natural talents.",,False,bad,,,
46,And human resources are like natural resources; they're often buried deep.,,False,bad,,,
47,"You have to go looking for them, they're not just lying around on the surface.",,False,bad,,,
48,You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves.,,False,bad,,,
49,"And you might imagine education would be the way that happens, but too often, it's not.",,False,bad,,,
50,Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it's not enough.,,False,bad,,,
51,"Reform is no use anymore, because that's simply improving a broken model.",,False,bad,,,
52,"What we need - and the word's been used many times in the past few days - is not evolution, but a revolution in education.",,False,bad,,,
53,This has to be transformed into something else.,,False,bad,,,
54,One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education.,,False,bad,,,
55,"Innovation is hard, because it means doing something that people don't find very easy, for the most part.",,False,bad,,,
56,"It means challenging what we take for granted, things that we think are obvious.",,False,bad,,,
57,The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense.,,False,bad,,,

77,"That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to, which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things, the way things are.",,False,bad,,,
78,"And many of our ideas have been formed, not to meet the circumstances of this century, but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.",,False,bad,,,

80,"Now, doing this is easier said than done.",,True,bad,,,
81,"It's very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted.",,True,bad,,,
82,And the reason is that you take it for granted.,,False,bad,,,

92,Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.,,True,bad,,,
93,"I don't mean they can't, they just often choose not to.",,False,bad,,,
94,"And the reason is we were brought up in a pre-digital culture, those of us over 25.",,False,bad,,,

107,A couple of examples.,,False,bad,,,
108,"One of them is the idea of linearity: that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right, you will end up set for the rest of your life.",,False,bad,,,
109,"Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly, or sometimes explicitly, a different story: that life is not linear; it's organic.",,False,bad,,,
110,We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us.,,False,bad,,,
111,"But, you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative.",,False,bad,,,

165,One is that human talent is tremendously diverse.,,False,bad,,,

182,"If you're doing something that doesn't resonate with your spirit, five minutes feels like an hour.",,False,bad,,,
183,"And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't feed their spirit, it doesn't feed their energy or their passion.",,False,bad,,,
184,So I think we have to change metaphors.,,False,bad,,,
185,"We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education, a manufacturing model, which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people.",,False,bad,,,
186,We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture.,,False,bad,,,

92,"But when we assume good or neutral intent, we give our minds a much stronger framework for dialogue.",,False,bad,,,
93,The second is ask questions.,,False,bad,,,
94,"When we engage people across ideological divides, asking questions helps us map the disconnect between our differing points of view.",,False,bad,,,
95,That's important because we can't present effective arguments if we don't understand where the other side is actually coming from and because it gives them an opportunity to point out flaws in our positions.,,False,bad,,,
96,But asking questions serves another purpose; it signals to someone that they're being heard.,,False,bad,,,
97,"When my friends on Twitter stopped accusing and started asking questions, I almost automatically mirrored them.",,True,bad,,,
98,"Their questions gave me room to speak, but they also gave me permission to ask them questions and to truly hear their responses.",,False,bad,,,

102,"At Westboro, I learned not to care how my manner of speaking affected others.",,False,bad,,,
103,"I thought my rightness justified my rudeness - harsh tones, raised voices, insults, interruptions - but that strategy is ultimately counterproductive.",,False,bad,,,
104,"Dialing up the volume and the snark is natural in stressful situations, but it tends to bring the conversation to an unsatisfactory, explosive end.",,False,bad,,,
105,"When my husband was still just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance, our discussions frequently became hard and pointed, but we always refused to escalate.",,True,bad,,,
106,"Instead, he would change the subject.",,False,bad,,,
107,He would tell a joke or recommend a book or gently excuse himself from the conversation.,,False,bad,,,
108,"We knew the discussion wasn't over, just paused for a time to bring us back to an even keel.",,False,bad,,,
109,"People often lament that digital communication makes us less civil, but this is one advantage that online conversations have over in-person ones.",,False,bad,,,
110,We have a buffer of time and space between us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating.,,False,bad,,,
111,We can use that buffer.,,False,bad,,,
112,"Instead of lashing out, we can pause, breathe, change the subject or walk away, and then come back to it when we're ready.",,False,bad,,,
113,And finally ... make the argument.,,True,bad,,,
114,"This might seem obvious, but one side effect of having strong beliefs is that we sometimes assume that the value of our position is or should be obvious and self-evident, that we shouldn't have to defend our positions because they're so clearly right and good that if someone doesn't get it, it's their problem - that it's not my job to educate them.",,False,bad,,,
115,"But if it were that simple, we would all see things the same way.",,False,bad,,,
116,"As kind as my friends on Twitter were, if they hadn't actually made their arguments, it would've been so much harder for me to see the world in a different way.",,False,bad,,,

120,My friends on Twitter didn't abandon their beliefs or their principles - only their scorn.,,True,bad,,,
121,They channeled their infinitely justifiable offense and came to me with pointed questions tempered with kindness and humor.,,False,bad,,,
122,"They approached me as a human being, and that was more transformative than two full decades of outrage, disdain and violence.",,False,bad,,,
123,"I know that some might not have the time or the energy or the patience for extensive engagement, but as difficult as it can be, reaching out to someone we disagree with is an option that is available to all of us.",,False,bad,,,
124,"And I sincerely believe that we can do hard things, not just for them but for us and our future.",,False,bad,,,
125,"Escalating disgust and intractable conflict are not what we want for ourselves, or our country or our next generation.",,False,bad,,,
126,"My mom said something to me a few weeks before I left Westboro, when I was desperately hoping there was a way I could stay with my family.",,False,bad,,,
127,"People I have loved with every pulse of my heart since even before I was that chubby-cheeked five-year-old, standing on a picket line holding a sign I couldn't read.",,False,bad,,,
128,"She said, ""You're just a human being, my dear, sweet child.""",,False,bad,,,
129,She was asking me to be humble - not to question but to trust God and my elders.,,False,bad,,,
130,"But to me, she was missing the bigger picture - that we're all just human beings.",,False,bad,,,
131,"That we should be guided by that most basic fact, and approach one another with generosity and compassion.",,False,bad,,,
132,Each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up.,,False,bad,,,
133,"The end of this spiral of rage and blame begins with one person who refuses to indulge these destructive, seductive impulses.",,False,bad,,,

12,In the astronaut business - the shuttle is a very complicated vehicle; it's the most complicated flying machine ever built.,,False,bad,,,

16,"And as the time gets closer and closer, this excitement is building.",,False,bad,,,
17,"And then about three and a half minutes before launch, the huge nozzles on the back, like the size of big church bells, swing back and forth and the mass of them is such that it sways the whole vehicle, like the vehicle is alive underneath you, like an elephant getting up off its knees or something.",,True,bad,,,
18,"And then about 30 seconds before launch, the vehicle is completely alive - it is ready to go - the APUs are running, the computers are all self-contained, it's ready to leave the planet.",,False,bad,,,
19,"And 15 seconds before launch, this happens: (Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10, nine, eight, seven, six - (Space shuttle preparing for takeoff) - start, two, one, booster ignition, and liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery, returning to the space station, paving the way ...

22,It's shaking you so hard you can't focus on the instruments in front of you.,,False,bad,,,
23,"It's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog and there's a foot in the small of your back pushing you into space, accelerating wildly straight up, shouldering your way through the air, and you're in a very complex place - paying attention, watching the vehicle go through each one of its wickets with a steadily increasing smile on your face.",,False,bad,,,
24,"After two minutes, those solid rockets explode off and then you just have the liquid engines, the hydrogen and oxygen, and it's as if you're in a dragster with your foot to the floor and accelerating like you've never accelerated.",,True,bad,,,
25,"You get lighter and lighter, the force gets on us heavier and heavier.",,False,bad,,,
26,It feels like someone's pouring cement on you or something.,,True,bad,,,
27,"Until finally, after about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so, we are finally at exactly the right altitude, exactly the right speed, the right direction, the engine shut off, and we're weightless.",,False,bad,,,
28,And we're alive.,,False,bad,,,
29,It's an amazing experience.,,False,bad,,,
30,But why would we take that risk?,,False,bad,,,
31,Why would you do something that dangerous?,,False,bad,,,
32,In my case the answer is fairly straightforward.,,False,bad,,,
33,I was inspired as a youngster that this was what I wanted to do.,,False,bad,,,
34,"I watched the first people walk on the moon and to me, it was just an obvious thing - I want to somehow turn myself into that.",,True,bad,,,
35,"But the real question is, how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it?",,False,bad,,,
36,How do you deal with fear versus danger?,,False,bad,,,
37,"And having the goal in mind, thinking about where it might lead, directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible, to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that's going around the world at five miles a second, eight kilometers a second, around the world 16 times a day, with experiments on board that are teaching us what the substance of the universe is made of and running 200 experiments inside.",,False,bad,,,
38,"But maybe even more importantly, allowing us to see the world in a way that is impossible through any other means, to be able to look down and have - if your jaw could drop, it would - the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic, constantly changing beauty that is the world itself.",,False,bad,,,
39,"And you see, because of the speed, a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year.",,True,bad,,,
40,And the most magnificent part of all that is to go outside on a spacewalk.,,True,bad,,,

42,"It's an entirely different perspective, you're not looking up at the universe, you and the Earth are going through the universe together.",,False,bad,,,
43,"And you're holding on with one hand, looking at the world turn beside you.",,False,bad,,,
44,It's roaring silently with color and texture as it pours by mesmerizingly next to you.,,False,bad,,,
45,"And if you can tear your eyes away from that and you look under your arm down at the rest of everything, it's unfathomable blackness, with a texture you feel like you could stick your hand into.",,False,bad,,,

48,Suddenly my left eye slammed shut in great pain and I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working.,,False,bad,,,
49,"I was thinking, what do I do next?",,True,bad,,,
50,"I thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes, so I kept working.",,False,bad,,,
51,"But unfortunately, without gravity, tears don't fall.",,True,bad,,,
52,"So you just get a bigger and bigger ball of whatever that is mixed with your tears on your eye until eventually, the ball becomes so big that the surface tension takes it across the bridge of your nose like a tiny little waterfall and goes ""goosh"" into your other eye, and now I was completely blind outside the spaceship.",,True,bad,,,
53,So what's the scariest thing you've ever done?,,True,bad,,,
54,(Laughter) Maybe it's spiders.,,True,bad,,,
55,A lot of people are afraid of spiders.,,True,bad,,,
56,"I think you should be afraid of spiders - spiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs, and spiders like this one, the brown recluse - it's horrible.",,True,bad,,,

58,And how do you know?,,False,bad,,,
59,"And so a spider lands on you, and you go through this great, spasmy attack because spiders are scary.",,True,bad,,,
60,"But then you could say, well is there a brown recluse sitting on the chair beside me or not?",,True,bad,,,
61,I don't know.,,True,bad,,,
62,Are there brown recluses here?,,True,bad,,,
63,"So if you actually do the research, you find out that in the world there are about 50,000 different types of spiders, and there are about two dozen that are venomous out of 50,000.",,False,bad,,,
64,"And if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters here in B.C., there's about 720, 730 different types of spiders and there's one - one - that is venomous, and its venom isn't even fatal, it's just kind of like a nasty sting.",,False,bad,,,
65,"And that spider - not only that, but that spider has beautiful markings on it, it's like ""I'm dangerous.",,True,bad,,,
66,"I got a big radiation symbol on my back, it's the black widow.""",,True,bad,,,
67,"So, if you're even slightly careful you can avoid running into the one spider - and it lives close the ground, you're walking along, you are never going to go through a spider web where a black widow bites you.",,True,bad,,,
68,"Spider webs like this, it doesn't build those, it builds them down in the corners.",,False,bad,,,
69,And its a black widow because the female spider eats the male; it doesn't care about you.,,True,bad,,,
70,"So in fact, the next time you walk into a spiderweb, you don't need to panic and go with your caveman reaction.",,True,bad,,,
71,The danger is entirely different than the fear.,,False,bad,,,
72,"How do you get around it, though?",,True,bad,,,
73,How do you change your behavior?,,False,bad,,,
74,"Well, next time you see a spiderweb, have a good look, make sure it's not a black widow spider, and then walk into it.",,True,bad,,,
75,And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one.,,False,bad,,,
76,It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff.,,True,bad,,,
77,It's not a big deal.,,True,bad,,,
78,And the spider that may come out is no more threat to you than a lady bug or a butterfly.,,True,bad,,,
79,"And then I guarantee you if you walk through 100 spiderwebs you will have changed your fundamental human behavior, your caveman reaction, and you will now be able to walk in the park in the morning and not worry about that spiderweb - or into your grandma's attic or whatever, into your own basement.",,True,bad,,,
80,And you can apply this to anything.,,False,bad,,,
81,"If you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded, your natural reaction would be to panic, I think.",,False,bad,,,
82,It would make you nervous and worried.,,False,bad,,,
83,"But we had considered all the venom, and we had practiced with a whole variety of different spiderwebs.",,False,bad,,,
84,We knew everything there is to know about the spacesuit and we trained underwater thousands of times.,,False,bad,,,
85,"And we don't just practice things going right, we practice things going wrong all the time, so that you are constantly walking through those spiderwebs.",,False,bad,,,
86,"And not just underwater, but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it's realistic.",,True,bad,,,
87,"So when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk, it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time.",,True,bad,,,
88,"And even if you're blinded, your natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen.",,False,bad,,,
89,"Instead you kind of look around and go, ""Okay, I can't see, but I can hear, I can talk, Scott Parazynski is out here with me.",,True,bad,,,

89,No!,,True,bad,,,

94,There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain; there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy; and there are people who like it extra chunky.,,True,bad,,,
95,"And of those three facts, the third one was the most significant, because at the time, in the early 1980s, if you went to a supermarket, you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.",,True,bad,,,

111,Now why is that important?,,False,bad,,,
112,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
113,"It is, in fact, enormously important.",,False,bad,,,
114,I'll explain to you why.,,False,bad,,,
115,What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy.,,False,bad,,,
116,"Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat, what will make people happy, is to ask them.",,True,bad,,,
117,"And for years and years and years, Ragù and Prego would have focus groups, and they would sit you down, and they would say, ""What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?",,True,bad,,,

119,"And for all those years - 20, 30 years - through all those focus group sessions, no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.",,True,bad,,,

123,It's a mystery!,,False,bad,,,

125,"And a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want, deep down.",,False,bad,,,
126,"If I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee, you know what you'd say?",,True,bad,,,

133,"Most of you like milky, weak coffee.",,True,bad,,,
134,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
135,"But you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want that ""I want a milky, weak coffee.""",,True,bad,,,
136,So that's number one thing that Howard did.,,False,bad,,,
137,"Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize - it's another very critical point - he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call ""horizontal segmentation.""",,False,bad,,,
138,Why is this critical?,,False,bad,,,
139,Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard.,,False,bad,,,
140,What were they obsessed with in the early 80s?,,True,bad,,,
141,They were obsessed with mustard.,,True,bad,,,

145,Yellow mustard.,,True,bad,,,
146,What's in it?,,True,bad,,,

157,"With the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon.",,True,bad,,,

159,"And the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off!",,True,bad,,,
160,Takes over the mustard business!,,True,bad,,,
161,"And everyone's take-home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive, something to aspire to.",,False,bad,,,
162,"It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now, and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.",,True,bad,,,
163,(Laughter) A better mustard!,,True,bad,,,
164,A more expensive mustard!,,True,bad,,,
165,A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning.,,False,bad,,,
166,"And Howard looked to that and said, ""That's wrong!""",,False,bad,,,
167,Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.,,False,bad,,,
168,"Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane.",,False,bad,,,
169,There is no good mustard or bad mustard.,,True,bad,,,
170,There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.,,True,bad,,,
171,There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.,,False,bad,,,
172,He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste.,,False,bad,,,
173,"And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.",,False,bad,,,
174,"Third thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important, is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.",,True,bad,,,

176,What do I mean by that?,,True,bad,,,
177,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
178,"For the longest time in the food industry, there was a sense that there was one way, a perfect way, to make a dish.",,False,bad,,,

182,No!,,True,bad,,,
183,You just get the reduction.,,False,bad,,,

190,Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well.,,False,bad,,,

192,And where did that come from?,,True,bad,,,
193,It came from Italy.,,False,bad,,,
194,Italian tomato sauce is what?,,True,bad,,,
195,It's blended; it's thin.,,False,bad,,,
196,The culture of tomato sauce was thin.,,False,bad,,,

198,"Which were thin, you just put a little bit and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.",,True,bad,,,
199,That's what it was.,,True,bad,,,
200,And why were we attached to that?,,False,bad,,,
201,"Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A. And B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce, then they would embrace it.",,True,bad,,,

101,And you start to see things.,,False,bad,,,
102,The things you see can be very complicated indeed.,,False,bad,,,

134,There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.,,True,bad,,,

143,And it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.,,False,bad,,,
144,"The temporal lobe hallucinations are all sense hallucinations, full of feeling, full of familiarity, located in space and time, coherent, dramatic.",,False,bad,,,
145,The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different.,,True,bad,,,
146,"In the Charles Bonnet hallucinations, you have all sorts of levels, from the geometrical hallucinations - the pink and blue squares the woman had - up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces.",,False,bad,,,
147,"Faces, and sometimes deformed faces, are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations.",,True,bad,,,
148,And one of the second commonest is cartoons.,,True,bad,,,
149,"So, what is going on?",,True,bad,,,
150,"Fascinatingly, in the last few years, it's been possible to do functional brain imagery, to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating, and, in fact, to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating.",,False,bad,,,
151,"When people have these simple, geometrical hallucinations, the primary visual cortex is activated.",,False,bad,,,
152,This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns.,,False,bad,,,
153,You don't form images with your primary visual cortex.,,False,bad,,,
154,"When images are formed, a higher part of the visual cortex is involved, in the temporal lobe.",,False,bad,,,

156,"And it's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus, they may lose the ability to recognize faces.",,False,bad,,,
157,"But if there's an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus, they may hallucinate faces, and this is exactly what you find in some of these people.",,True,bad,,,
158,"There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented, and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations.",,False,bad,,,
159,There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons.,,False,bad,,,
160,"It's activated when one recognizes cartoons, when one draws cartoons and when one hallucinates them.",,True,bad,,,
161,It's very interesting that that should be specific.,,False,bad,,,
162,There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes.,,False,bad,,,

168,I had to bring it in.,,False,bad,,,
169,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
170,"And now it's in there, somewhere.",,True,bad,,,
171,"So - (Laughter) now, at this level, in what's called the inferotemporal cortex, there are only visual images, or figments or fragments.",,False,bad,,,
172,It's only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion.,,False,bad,,,
173,"And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome, you don't go to those higher levels.",,False,bad,,,
174,"You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex, where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images, or figments or fragmentary figments, all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells.",,False,bad,,,
175,"Normally, these are all part of the integrated stream of perception, or imagination, and one is not conscious of them.",,False,bad,,,
176,It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted.,,False,bad,,,
177,"And instead of getting normal perception, you're getting an anarchic, convulsive stimulation, or release, of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex.",,False,bad,,,

179,"Suddenly, you see a car.",,False,bad,,,
180,Suddenly this and suddenly that.,,False,bad,,,
181,"The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this, but not terribly successfully.",,False,bad,,,

188,I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common.,,False,bad,,,
189,Think of the number of blind people.,,False,bad,,,
190,There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations but are too scared to mention them.,,True,bad,,,

192,"Finally, I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable, for giving one some insight as to how the brain works.",,False,bad,,,
193,"Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago - he wondered how, thinking of these hallucinations, how, as he put it, the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain.",,False,bad,,,

71,"So I started to crunch some numbers, and that allowed me to make some correlations.",,False,bad,,,

86,"I'm going to keep using these online dating sites, but I'm going to treat them as databases, and rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up, I think I'm going to try reverse-engineering this entire system.",,True,bad,,,
87,"So knowing that there was superficial data that was being used to match me up with other people, I decided instead to ask my own questions.",,False,bad,,,
88,What was every single possible thing that I could think of that I was looking for in a mate?,,True,bad,,,
89,"So I started writing and writing and writing, and at the end, I had amassed 72 different data points.",,False,bad,,,

100,These things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers.,,True,bad,,,

28,You're all bombarded with that.,,False,bad,,,
29,I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab.,,False,bad,,,
30,"What we do in the lab is actually measure directly, in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact of video games on the brain.",,False,bad,,,
31,And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.,,False,bad,,,
32,One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard is the fact that too much screen time makes your eyesight worse.,,False,bad,,,
33,That's a statement about vision.,,False,bad,,,
34,There may be vision scientists among you.,,False,bad,,,
35,We actually know how to test that statement.,,False,bad,,,
36,We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.,,False,bad,,,
37,"Well, guess what?",,True,bad,,,
38,"People that don't play a lot of action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time in front of screens, have normal, or what we call corrective-to-normal vision.",,False,bad,,,
39,That's okay.,,True,bad,,,
40,"The issue is what happens with these guys that actually indulge into playing video games like five hours per week, 10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.",,False,bad,,,
41,"By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?",,False,bad,,,
42,Guess what?,,True,bad,,,
43,"Their vision is really, really good.",,False,bad,,,
44,It's better than those that don't play.,,True,bad,,,
45,And it's better in two different ways.,,False,bad,,,
46,"The first way is that they're actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it with just your eyesight.",,False,bad,,,
47,The other way that they are better is actually being able to resolve different levels of gray.,,True,bad,,,
48,Imagine you're driving in a fog.,,True,bad,,,
49,"That makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.",,False,bad,,,
50,"So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games for patients with low vision, and to have an impact on retraining their brain to see better.",,False,bad,,,
51,"Clearly, when it comes to action video games, screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.",,True,bad,,,
52,Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around: Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.,,True,bad,,,
53,"Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.",,True,bad,,,
54,I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.,,False,bad,,,
55,"I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have to actually play the game with me.",,False,bad,,,
56,I'm going to show you colored words.,,False,bad,,,
57,I want you to shout out the color of the ink.,,False,bad,,,
58,Right?,,True,bad,,,
59,So this is the first example.,,True,bad,,,
60,"[""Chair""]",,True,bad,,,
61,"Orange, good.",,True,bad,,,
62,"[""Table""] Green.",,False,bad,,,
63,"[""Board""]",,True,bad,,,
64,Audience: Red.,,True,bad,,,
65,"Daphne Bavelier: Red. [""Horse""] DB: Yellow.",,True,bad,,,
66,Audience: Yellow.,,True,bad,,,
67,"[""Yellow""] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.",,True,bad,,,
68,"[""Blue""] DB: Yellow.",,True,bad,,,
69,"Okay, you get my point, right?",,True,bad,,,
70,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
71,"You're getting better, but it's hard.",,False,bad,,,
72,Why is it hard?,,False,bad,,,
73,Because I introduced a conflict between the word itself and its color.,,False,bad,,,
74,"How good your attention is determines actually how fast you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better than some of us that are older.",,True,bad,,,
75,"What we can show is that when you do this kind of task with people that play a lot of action games, they actually resolve the conflict faster.",,False,bad,,,
76,So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead to attention problems.,,True,bad,,,
77,"Actually, those action video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention, and one aspect of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to track objects around in the world.",,False,bad,,,
78,This is something we use all the time.,,True,bad,,,
79,"When you're driving, you're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.",,False,bad,,,
80,"You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog, and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?",,True,bad,,,
81,"In the lab, we get people to come to the lab, sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.",,False,bad,,,
82,You're going to see yellow happy faces and a few sad blue faces.,,False,bad,,,
83,These are children in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess during the winter.,,False,bad,,,
84,Most kids are happy.,,True,bad,,,
85,It's actually recess.,,True,bad,,,
86,But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.,,True,bad,,,
87,"Everybody begins to move around, and your task is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning and who didn't.",,True,bad,,,
88,So I'm just going to show you an example where there is only one sad kid.,,True,bad,,,
89,It's easy because you can actually track it with your eyes.,,False,bad,,,
90,"You can track, you can track, and then when it stops, and there is a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?",,True,bad,,,
91,Was it yellow initially or blue?,,False,bad,,,
92,I hear a few yellow.,,False,bad,,,
93,Good.,,False,bad,,,
94,So most of you have a brain.,,True,bad,,,
95,"(Laughter) I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with a little more challenging task.",,True,bad,,,
96,There are going to be three of them that are blue.,,False,bad,,,
97,Don't move your eyes.,,False,bad,,,
98,Please don't move your eyes.,,False,bad,,,
99,"Keep your eyes fixated and expand, pull your attention.",,False,bad,,,
100,That's the only way you can actually do it.,,False,bad,,,
101,"If you move your eyes, you're doomed.",,True,bad,,,
102,Yellow or blue?,,True,bad,,,
103,Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.,,True,bad,,,
104,So your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention.,,False,bad,,,
105,That's what we just did.,,True,bad,,,
106,"Your action video game player has a span of about six to seven objects of attention, which is what is shown in this video here.",,False,bad,,,
107,"That's for you guys, action video game players.",,True,bad,,,
108,"A bit more challenging, right?",,True,bad,,,
109,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
110,Yellow or blue?,,True,bad,,,
111,Blue.,,False,bad,,,
112,We have some people that are serious out there.,,True,bad,,,
113,Yeah.,,True,bad,,,
114,(Laughter) Good.,,True,bad,,,
115,"So in the same way that we actually see the effects of video games on people's behavior, we can use brain imaging and look at the impact of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes, but the main changes are actually to the brain networks that control attention.",,False,bad,,,
116,So one part is the parietal cortex which is very well known to control the orientation of attention.,,False,bad,,,
117,"The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls how we sustain attention, and another one is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict.",,False,bad,,,
118,"Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three of these networks are actually much more efficient in people that play action games.",,False,bad,,,
119,This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding in the literature about technology and the brain.,,False,bad,,,
120,You all know about multitasking.,,False,bad,,,
121,You all have been faulty of multitasking when you're driving and you pick up your cellphone.,,True,bad,,,
122,Bad idea.,,True,bad,,,
123,Very bad idea.,,True,bad,,,
124,Why?,,False,bad,,,
125,"Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone, you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly to the car braking in front of you, and so you're much more likely to get engaged into a car accident.",,True,bad,,,
126,"Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.",,False,bad,,,
127,We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have.,,True,bad,,,
128,That would be a little costly proposition.,,False,bad,,,
129,"But we design tasks on the computer where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy, how good they are at switching from one task to another.",,False,bad,,,
130,"When we do that, we actually find that people that play a lot of action games are really, really good.",,False,bad,,,
131,"They switch really fast, very swiftly.",,False,bad,,,
132,They pay a very small cost.,,False,bad,,,
133,"Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it in the context of another group of technology users, a group which is actually much revered by society, which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.",,False,bad,,,
134,What is multimedia-tasking?,,False,bad,,,
135,"It's the fact that most of us, most of our children, are engaged with listening to music at the same time as they're doing search on the web at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.",,False,bad,,,
136,That's a multimedia-tasker.,,False,bad,,,
137,There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford and that we replicated that showed that those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.,,False,bad,,,
138,"When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.",,True,bad,,,
139,Right?,,True,bad,,,
140,So these kinds of results really makes two main points.,,False,bad,,,
141,The first one is that not all media are created equal.,,False,bad,,,
142,You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking and the effect of playing action games.,,True,bad,,,
143,"They have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition, perception and attention.",,False,bad,,,
144,"Even within video games, I'm telling you right now about these action-packed video games.",,False,bad,,,
145,Different video games have a different effect on your brains.,,False,bad,,,
146,So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game.,,False,bad,,,
147,The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.,,False,bad,,,
148,"I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers have a lot of very good vision, etc.",,False,bad,,,
149,"Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates that actually report engaging in a lot of high multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.",,True,bad,,,
150,"So you show them their data, you show them they are bad and they're like, ""Not possible.""",,True,bad,,,
151,"You know, they have this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.",,False,bad,,,
152,That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.,,False,bad,,,
153,"Now in a sense, when we think about the effect of video games on the brain, it's very similar to the effect of wine on the health.",,False,bad,,,
154,There are some very poor uses of wine.,,False,bad,,,
155,There are some very poor uses of video games.,,False,bad,,,
156,"But when consumed in reasonable doses, and at the right age, wine can be very good for health.",,False,bad,,,
157,There are actually specific molecules that have been identified in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.,,False,bad,,,
158,"So it's the same way, like those action video games have a number of ingredients that are actually really powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention, vision, etc., and so we need and we're working on understanding what are those active ingredients so that we can really then leverage them to deliver better games, either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.",,False,bad,,,
159,"Now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform.",,False,bad,,,
160,"I'm much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game, I can actually change your vision for the better, whether you want to play that action game or not, right?",,True,bad,,,
161,That's the point of rehabilitation or education.,,False,bad,,,
162,"Most of the kids don't go to school saying, ""Great, two hours of math!""",,True,bad,,,
163,"So that's really the crux of the research, and to do that, we need to go one more step.",,False,bad,,,
164,And one more step is to do training studies.,,True,bad,,,
165,So let me illustrate that step with a task which is called mental rotation.,,False,bad,,,
166,"Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you, and again you're going to do the task, to look at this shape.",,False,bad,,,
167,"Study it, it's a target shape, and I'm going to present to you four different shapes.",,False,bad,,,
168,One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated version of this shape.,,False,bad,,,
169,"I want you to tell me which one: the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?",,True,bad,,,
170,"Okay, I'll help you.",,False,bad,,,
171,Fourth one.,,False,bad,,,
172,One more.,,False,bad,,,
173,Get those brains working.,,True,bad,,,
174,Come on.,,False,bad,,,
175,That's our target shape.,,True,bad,,,
176,Third.,,False,bad,,,
177,Good!,,False,bad,,,
178,"This is hard, right?",,True,bad,,,
179,"Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because you really feel your brain cringing, right?",,True,bad,,,
180,It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.,,True,bad,,,
181,"Well, what we do in these training studies is, people come to the lab, they do tasks like this one, we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.",,False,bad,,,
182,They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.,,True,bad,,,
183,"They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes several days over a period of two weeks.",,True,bad,,,
184,"Then, once they are done with the training, they come back a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type of mental rotation task.",,False,bad,,,
185,So this is work from a colleague in Toronto.,,False,bad,,,
186,"What they showed is that, initially, you know, subjects perform where they are expected to perform given their age.",,False,bad,,,
187,"After two weeks of training on action video games, they actually perform better, and the improvement is still there five months after having done the training.",,False,bad,,,
188,"That's really, really important.",,False,bad,,,
189,Why?,,False,bad,,,
190,Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation.,,False,bad,,,
191,We need to have effects that are going to be long-lasting.,,False,bad,,,
192,"Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market a game that would be good for the attention of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy, or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?",,True,bad,,,
193,"Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.",,False,bad,,,
194,"There are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going to call the broccoli side of the equation.",,True,bad,,,
195,There is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can't resist.,,False,bad,,,
196,That's the chocolate side of the equation.,,True,bad,,,
197,"The issue is we need to put the two together, and it's a little bit like with food.",,True,bad,,,
198,Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?,,True,bad,,,
199,None of you.,,True,bad,,,
200,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
201,"And you probably have had that feeling, right, picking up an education game and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun, it's not really engaging.",,False,bad,,,
202,"So what we need is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate that is irresistible, that you really want to play, but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize but are still working on your brains.",,False,bad,,,
203,"And we're working on it, but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together, people that work in the entertainment software industry, and publishers, so these are not people that usually meet every day, but it's actually doable, and we are on the right track.",,False,bad,,,
204,"I'd like to leave you with that thought, and thank you for your attention.",,False,bad,,,
0,I want to start with a game.,,False,bad,,,
1,Okay?,,True,bad,,,
2,"And to win this game, all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you as it really is, all right?",,False,bad,,,
3,"So we have two panels here, of colored dots.",,False,bad,,,
4,And one of those dots is the same in the two panels.,,False,bad,,,
5,And you have to tell me which one.,,False,bad,,,
6,"Now, I narrowed it down to the gray one, the green one, and, say, the orange one.",,True,bad,,,
7,"So by a show of hands, we'll start with the easiest one.",,False,bad,,,
8,Show of hands: how many people think it's the gray one?,,True,bad,,,
9,Really?,,True,bad,,,
10,Okay.,,True,bad,,,
11,How many people think it's the green one?,,True,bad,,,
12,And how many people think it's the orange one?,,True,bad,,,
13,Pretty even split.,,True,bad,,,
14,Let's find out what the reality is.,,False,bad,,,
15,Here is the orange one.,,True,bad,,,
16,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
17,Here is the green one.,,True,bad,,,
18,And here is the gray one.,,True,bad,,,
19,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
20,"So for all of you who saw that, you're complete realists.",,True,bad,,,
21,All right?,,False,bad,,,
22,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
23,"So this is pretty amazing, isn't it?",,False,bad,,,
24,Because nearly every living system has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another.,,False,bad,,,
25,"So for us, seeing color is one of the simplest things the brain does.",,False,bad,,,
26,"And yet, even at this most fundamental level, context is everything.",,False,bad,,,
27,"What I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything, but why context is everything.",,False,bad,,,
28,"Because it's answering that question that tells us not only why we see what we do, but who we are as individuals, and who we are as a society.",,False,bad,,,
29,"But first, we have to ask another question, which is, ""What is color for?""",,False,bad,,,
30,"And instead of telling you, I'll just show you.",,False,bad,,,
31,"What you see here is a jungle scene, and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light that those surfaces reflect.",,False,bad,,,
32,"Now, can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you?",,True,bad,,,
33,"And if you haven't seen it yet, you're dead, right?",,True,bad,,,
34,(Laughter) Can anyone see it?,,True,bad,,,
35,Anyone?,,True,bad,,,
36,No?,,True,bad,,,
37,Now let's see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect.,,False,bad,,,
38,And now you see it.,,False,bad,,,
39,"So, color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces, according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect.",,False,bad,,,
40,But what you've just done is in many respects mathematically impossible.,,False,bad,,,
41,Why?,,False,bad,,,
42,"Because, as Berkeley tells us, we have no direct access to our physical world, other than through our senses.",,False,bad,,,
43,"And the light that falls onto our eyes is determined by multiple things in the world, not only the color of objects, but also the color of their illumination, and the color of the space between us and those objects.",,False,bad,,,
44,"You vary any one of those parameters, and you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye.",,False,bad,,,
45,"This is a huge problem, because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources.",,False,bad,,,
46,Let me show you what I mean.,,False,bad,,,
47,"Imagine that this is the back of your eye, okay?",,True,bad,,,
48,And these are two projections from the world.,,False,bad,,,
49,They're identical in every single way.,,False,bad,,,
50,"Identical in shape, size, spectral content.",,False,bad,,,
51,"They are the same, as far as your eye is concerned.",,False,bad,,,
52,And yet they come from completely different sources.,,False,bad,,,
53,"The one on the right comes from a yellow surface, in shadow, oriented facing the left, viewed through a pinkish medium.",,False,bad,,,
54,"The one on the left comes from an orange surface, under direct light, facing to the right, viewed through sort of a bluish medium.",,False,bad,,,
55,"Completely different meanings, giving rise to the exact same retinal information.",,False,bad,,,
56,And yet it's only the retinal information that we get.,,False,bad,,,
57,So how on Earth do we even see?,,True,bad,,,
58,"So if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes, remember this: that the light that falls onto your eye, sensory information, is meaningless, because it could mean literally anything.",,False,bad,,,
59,And what's true for sensory information is true for information generally.,,False,bad,,,
60,There's no inherent meaning in information.,,False,bad,,,
61,It's what we do with that information that matters.,,False,bad,,,
62,"So, how do we see?",,False,bad,,,
63,"Well, we see by learning to see.",,False,bad,,,
64,"The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns, finding relationships in information, and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning, a significance, by interacting with the world.",,False,bad,,,
65,"We're very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes, like language.",,False,bad,,,
66,"I'm going to give you some letter strings, and I want you to read them out for me, if you can.",,True,bad,,,
67,"Audience: ""Can you read this?""",,False,bad,,,
68,"""You are not reading this.""",,True,bad,,,
69,"""What are you reading?""",,False,bad,,,
70,"Beau Lotto: ""What are you reading?""",,True,bad,,,
71,"Half the letters are missing, right?",,True,bad,,,
72,"There's no a priori reason why an ""H"" has to go between that ""W"" and ""A.""",,True,bad,,,
73,But you put one there.,,True,bad,,,
74,Why?,,False,bad,,,
75,"Because in the statistics of your past experience, it would have been useful to do so.",,True,bad,,,
76,So you do so again.,,True,bad,,,
77,"And yet you don't put a letter after that first ""T.""",,True,bad,,,
78,Why?,,False,bad,,,
79,Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past.,,False,bad,,,
80,So you don't do it again.,,True,bad,,,
81,"So, let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality, even at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color.",,False,bad,,,
82,So if I could have the lights down up here.,,False,bad,,,
83,I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same.,,False,bad,,,
84,One is simply the flipping of the other.,,False,bad,,,
85,Now I want you to look at that dot between the green and the red.,,False,bad,,,
86,And I want you to stare at that dot.,,True,bad,,,
87,Don't look anywhere else.,,True,bad,,,
88,"We're going to look at it for about 30 seconds, which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.",,True,bad,,,
89,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
90,But I really want you to learn.,,False,bad,,,
91,And I'll tell you - don't look anywhere else - I'll tell you what's happening in your head.,,False,bad,,,
92,"Your brain is learning, and it's learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination.",,False,bad,,,
93,That's what it's learning.,,False,bad,,,
94,Okay?,,True,bad,,,
95,"Now, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes.",,False,bad,,,
96,So why don't you do that now?,,True,bad,,,
97,(Laughter) Can I have the lights up again?,,True,bad,,,
98,"I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore, right?",,True,bad,,,
99,Why?,,False,bad,,,
100,"Because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light, and the left one is still under green light.",,False,bad,,,
101,That's your new normal.,,False,bad,,,
102,Okay?,,True,bad,,,
103,"So, what does this mean for context?",,False,bad,,,
104,"It means I can take two identical squares, put them in light and dark surrounds, and the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround.",,False,bad,,,
105,What's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter.,,False,bad,,,
106,It's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past.,,False,bad,,,
107,So I'll show you what I mean.,,False,bad,,,
108,Here we have that exact same illusion.,,False,bad,,,
109,"We have two identical tiles on the left, one in a dark surround, one in a light surround.",,False,bad,,,
110,And the same thing over on the right.,,False,bad,,,
111,"Now, I'll reveal those two scenes, but I'm not going to change anything within those boxes, except their meaning.",,False,bad,,,
112,And see what happens to your perception.,,False,bad,,,
113,"Notice that on the left the two tiles look nearly completely opposite: one very white and one very dark, right?",,False,bad,,,
114,"Whereas on the right, the two tiles look nearly the same.",,False,bad,,,
115,"And yet there is still one on a dark surround, and one on a light surround.",,True,bad,,,
116,Why?,,False,bad,,,
117,"Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow, and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow, it would have to be more reflective - just the laws of physics.",,False,bad,,,
118,So you see it that way.,,True,bad,,,
119,"Whereas on the right, the information is consistent with those two tiles being under the same light.",,False,bad,,,
120,"If they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye, then they must be equally reflective.",,False,bad,,,
121,So you see it that way.,,True,bad,,,

139,"And for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction.",,True,bad,,,
140,Now I want you to keep looking at it.,,False,bad,,,
141,"Move your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye.",,False,bad,,,
142,"And suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction.",,False,bad,,,
143,Yes?,,True,bad,,,

145,Yes?,,True,bad,,,
146,Keep blinking.,,False,bad,,,

152,Are we the only ones that see illusions?,,True,bad,,,
153,The answer to this question is no.,,True,bad,,,
154,"Even the beautiful bumblebee, with its mere one million brain cells, which is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina, sees illusions, does the most complicated things that even our most sophisticated computers can't do.",,False,bad,,,
155,"So in my lab we work on bumblebees, because we can completely control their experience, and see how it alters the architecture of their brain.",,False,bad,,,
156,We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.,,False,bad,,,
157,Here you have the hive.,,False,bad,,,
158,"You can see the queen bee, the large bee in the middle.",,False,bad,,,
159,"Those are her daughters, the eggs.",,False,bad,,,

179,It looks like they're going to green flowers.,,True,bad,,,
180,"Now, are they getting it wrong?",,True,bad,,,
181,And the answer to the question is no.,,False,bad,,,
182,Those are actually blue flowers.,,True,bad,,,
183,But those are blue flowers under green light.,,False,bad,,,
184,"So they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle, which is exactly what we do.",,False,bad,,,
185,"So, illusions are often used, especially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist, ""to demonstrate the fragility of our senses.""",,False,bad,,,

190,We can't.,,False,bad,,,

209,"So, working with kids, they created images, thinking about what might the images you see sound like if we could listen to them.",,False,bad,,,

216,Okay?,,True,bad,,,
217,"Now, what does all this mean?",,False,bad,,,
218,"What this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature, okay?",,True,bad,,,

220,"We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment, by our ecology.",,False,bad,,,

223,Because what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty.,,False,bad,,,
224,Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding.,,False,bad,,,

227,And what we have here -,,False,bad,,,
228,"Can everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left, and 25, call it yellowish, surfaces on your right?",,True,bad,,,
229,"So now, what I want to do, I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination, by simply putting a filter behind them.",,False,bad,,,
230,"Now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there, right?",,False,bad,,,
231,Because now the light is going through a yellowish filter and then a purplish filter.,,False,bad,,,
232,I'm going to do the opposite on the left here.,,False,bad,,,
233,I'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light.,,False,bad,,,

235,Agreed?,,True,bad,,,
236,Yes?,,True,bad,,,
237,Okay.,,True,bad,,,

0,"So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book, and it's a story of something that happened 3,000 years ago, when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy.",,False,bad,,,
1,And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel.,,False,bad,,,
2,"And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it, and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn't understand it at all.",,False,bad,,,
3,"Ancient Palestine had a - along its eastern border, there's a mountain range.",,False,bad,,,
4,Still same is true of Israel today.,,False,bad,,,
5,"And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region, so Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron.",,False,bad,,,
6,"And then there's a coastal plain along the Mediterranean, where Tel Aviv is now.",,False,bad,,,
7,"And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah, which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west, and you can follow the Shephelah, go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains.",,False,bad,,,
8,"And the Shephelah, if you've been to Israel, you'll know it's just about the most beautiful part of Israel.",,False,bad,,,
9,"It's gorgeous, with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards.",,False,bad,,,
10,"But more importantly, though, in the history of that region, it's served, it's had a real strategic function, and that is, it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way, get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains.",,False,bad,,,
11,"And 3,000 years ago, that's exactly what happens.",,False,bad,,,
12,"The Philistines, who are the biggest of enemies of the Kingdom of Israel, are living in the coastal plain.",,False,bad,,,
13,They're originally from Crete.,,False,bad,,,
14,They're a seafaring people.,,False,bad,,,
15,"And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains, because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two.",,False,bad,,,
16,"And the Kingdom of Israel, which is headed by King Saul, obviously catches wind of this, and Saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah, one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah.",,False,bad,,,
17,"And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge, and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge, and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other, because they're deadlocked.",,False,bad,,,
18,"Neither can attack the other, because to attack the other side you've got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side, and you're completely exposed.",,False,bad,,,
19,"So finally, to break the deadlock, the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor, and he calls out and he says to the Israelites, ""Send your mightiest warrior down, and we'll have this out, just the two of us.""",,True,bad,,,
20,This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat.,,False,bad,,,
21,It was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle.,,False,bad,,,
22,"And the Philistine who is sent down, their mighty warrior, is a giant.",,True,bad,,,
23,He's 6 foot 9.,,False,bad,,,
24,"He's outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor, and he's got a sword and he's got a javelin and he's got his spear.",,False,bad,,,
25,He is absolutely terrifying.,,False,bad,,,
26,And he's so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him.,,False,bad,,,
27,"It's a death wish, right?",,True,bad,,,
28,There's no way they think they can take him.,,False,bad,,,
29,"And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy, and he goes up to Saul and he says, ""I'll fight him.""",,False,bad,,,
30,"And Saul says, ""You can't fight him.",,False,bad,,,
31,That's ridiculous.,,True,bad,,,
32,You're this kid.,,False,bad,,,
33,"This is this mighty warrior.""",,False,bad,,,
34,But the shepherd is adamant.,,False,bad,,,
35,"He says, ""No, no, no, you don't understand, I have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years.",,False,bad,,,
36,"I think I can do it.""",,False,bad,,,
37,And Saul has no choice.,,False,bad,,,
38,He's got no one else who's come forward.,,False,bad,,,
39,"So he says, ""All right.""",,False,bad,,,
40,"And then he turns to the kid, and he says, ""But you've got to wear this armor.",,True,bad,,,
41,"You can't go as you are.""",,False,bad,,,
42,"So he tries to give the shepherd his armor, and the shepherd says, ""No.""",,False,bad,,,
43,"He says, ""I can't wear this stuff.""",,True,bad,,,
44,"The Biblical verse is, ""I cannot wear this for I have not proved it,"" meaning, ""I've never worn armor before.",,True,bad,,,
45,"You've got to be crazy.""",,True,bad,,,
46,So he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd's bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant.,,False,bad,,,
47,"And the giant sees this figure approaching, and calls out, ""Come to me so I can feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field.""",,False,bad,,,
48,He issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him.,,False,bad,,,
49,"And the shepherd draws closer and closer, and the giant sees that he's carrying a staff.",,False,bad,,,
50,That's all he's carrying.,,True,bad,,,
51,"Instead of a weapon, just this shepherd's staff, and he says - he's insulted -",,True,bad,,,
52,"""Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks?""",,True,bad,,,
53,"And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket, puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes - right here, in his most vulnerable spot - and he falls down either dead or unconscious, and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head, and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run.",,True,bad,,,
54,"And of course, the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David, and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story turned out to be wrong.",,False,bad,,,
55,"So David, in that story, is supposed to be the underdog, right?",,True,bad,,,
56,"In fact, that term, David and Goliath, has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger.",,True,bad,,,
57,Now why do we call David an underdog?,,False,bad,,,
58,"Well, we call him an underdog because he's a kid, a little kid, and Goliath is this big, strong giant.",,False,bad,,,
59,"We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior, and David is just a shepherd.",,True,bad,,,
60,"But most importantly, we call him an underdog because all he has is - it's that Goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry, this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear, and all David has is this sling.",,True,bad,,,
61,"Well, let's start there with the phrase ""All David has is this sling,"" because that's the first mistake that we make.",,True,bad,,,
62,"In ancient warfare, there are three kinds of warriors.",,False,bad,,,
63,"There's cavalry, men on horseback and with chariots.",,False,bad,,,
64,"There's heavy infantry, which are foot soldiers, armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor.",,False,bad,,,
65,"And there's artillery, and artillery are archers, but, more importantly, slingers.",,True,bad,,,
66,"And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it, and they put a projectile, either a rock or a lead ball, inside the pouch, and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go, and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target.",,False,bad,,,
67,"That's what David has, and it's important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot.",,True,bad,,,
68,"It's not this, right?",,True,bad,,,
69,It's not a child's toy.,,False,bad,,,
70,It's in fact an incredibly devastating weapon.,,False,bad,,,
71,"When David rolls it around like this, he's turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second, and that means that when the rock is released, it's going forward really fast, probably 35 meters per second.",,False,bad,,,
72,That's substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers.,,True,bad,,,
73,"More than that, the stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks.",,False,bad,,,
74,"They were barium sulphate, which are rocks twice the density of normal stones.",,False,bad,,,
75,"If you do the calculations on the ballistics, on the stopping power of the rock fired from David's sling, it's roughly equal to the stopping power of a [.45 caliber] handgun.",,True,bad,,,
76,This is an incredibly devastating weapon.,,False,bad,,,
77,"Accuracy, we know from historical records that slingers - experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards.",,False,bad,,,
78,"From medieval tapestries, we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight.",,True,bad,,,
79,They were incredibly accurate.,,False,bad,,,
80,"When David lines up - and he's not 200 yards away from Goliath, he's quite close to Goliath - when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath, he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes.",,True,bad,,,
81,"If you go back over the history of ancient warfare, you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another.",,False,bad,,,
82,So what's Goliath?,,True,bad,,,
83,"He's heavy infantry, and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel is that he's going to be fighting another heavy infantryman.",,True,bad,,,
84,"When he says, ""Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"" the key phrase is ""Come to me.""",,True,bad,,,
85,"Come up to me because we're going to fight, hand to hand, like this.",,True,bad,,,
86,Saul has the same expectation.,,False,bad,,,
87,"David says, ""I want to fight Goliath,"" and Saul tries to give him his armor, because Saul is thinking, ""Oh, when you say 'fight Goliath,' you mean 'fight him in hand-to-hand combat,' infantry on infantry.""",,True,bad,,,
88,But David has absolutely no expectation.,,False,bad,,,
89,He's not going to fight him that way.,,False,bad,,,
90,Why would he?,,False,bad,,,
91,He's a shepherd.,,False,bad,,,
92,He's spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves.,,True,bad,,,
93,That's where his strength lies.,,False,bad,,,
94,"So here he is, this shepherd, experienced in the use of a devastating weapon, up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short-range combat.",,False,bad,,,
95,Goliath is a sitting duck.,,True,bad,,,
96,He doesn't have a chance.,,False,bad,,,
97,"So why do we keep calling David an underdog, and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable?",,False,bad,,,
98,There's a second piece of this that's important.,,False,bad,,,
99,It's not just that we misunderstand David and his choice of weaponry.,,False,bad,,,
100,It's also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath.,,False,bad,,,
101,Goliath is not what he seems to be.,,False,bad,,,
102,"There's all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text, things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and don't square with his image as this mighty warrior.",,False,bad,,,
103,"So to begin with, the Bible says that Goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant.",,True,bad,,,
104,"Now that is weird, right?",,True,bad,,,
105,Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat.,,False,bad,,,
106,"Why is he being led by the hand by some young boy, presumably, to the point of combat?",,False,bad,,,
107,"Secondly, the Bible story makes special note of how slowly Goliath moves, another odd thing to say when you're describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point.",,True,bad,,,
108,And then there's this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David.,,True,bad,,,
109,"So David's coming down the mountain, and he's clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat.",,False,bad,,,
110,"There is nothing about him that says, ""I am about to fight you like this.""",,True,bad,,,
111,He's not even carrying a sword.,,False,bad,,,
112,Why does Goliath not react to that?,,True,bad,,,
113,It's as if he's oblivious to what's going on that day.,,False,bad,,,
114,"And then there's that strange comment he makes to David: ""Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?""",,True,bad,,,
115,Sticks?,,True,bad,,,
116,David only has one stick.,,True,bad,,,
117,"Well, it turns out that there's been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with Goliath, an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies.",,False,bad,,,
118,There have been many articles written.,,False,bad,,,
119,"The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal, and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for Goliath's height.",,False,bad,,,
120,"So Goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era, and usually when someone is that far out of the norm, there's an explanation for it.",,True,bad,,,
121,"So the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly, and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone.",,True,bad,,,
122,"And throughout history, many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly.",,True,bad,,,
123,So the tallest person of all time was a guy named Robert Wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of 24 and he was 8 foot 11.,,True,bad,,,
124,He had acromegaly.,,False,bad,,,
125,Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant?,,True,bad,,,
126,Famous.,,False,bad,,,
127,He had acromegaly.,,False,bad,,,
128,There's even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly.,,True,bad,,,
129,"Anyone who's unusually tall, that's the first explanation we come up with.",,True,bad,,,
130,"And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it, principally having to do with vision.",,False,bad,,,
131,"The pituitary tumor, as it grows, often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain, with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted.",,False,bad,,,
132,"So when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with Goliath, they've said, ""Wait a minute, he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly.""",,True,bad,,,
133,And that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day.,,False,bad,,,
134,Why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant?,,True,bad,,,
135,Because he can't make his way on his own.,,False,bad,,,
136,Why is he so strangely oblivious to David that he doesn't understand that David's not going to fight him until the very last moment?,,True,bad,,,
137,Because he can't see him.,,False,bad,,,
138,"When he says, ""Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field,"" the phrase ""come to me"" is a hint also of his vulnerability.",,True,bad,,,
139,Come to me because I can't see you.,,False,bad,,,
140,"And then there's, ""Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks?""",,True,bad,,,
141,He sees two sticks when David has only one.,,False,bad,,,
142,So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe.,,False,bad,,,
143,What they didn't understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness.,,False,bad,,,
144,"And there is, I think, in that, a very important lesson for all of us.",,False,bad,,,
145,Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem.,,False,bad,,,
146,And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket.,,False,bad,,,

5,"That's okay, because check it out - I have math to prove that it is possible.",,False,bad,,,

7,"I'll explain it all later, just pay attention to the number at the bottom: +7.68245837 minutes.",,True,bad,,,

10,Your mission is to figure out how you want to spend your extra seven and a half minutes.,,True,bad,,,

12,You weren't going to have them anyway.,,False,bad,,,
13,"Now, because I'm a game designer, you might be thinking to yourself, I know what she wants us to do with those minutes, she wants us to spend them playing games.",,False,bad,,,
14,"Now this is a totally reasonable assumption, given that I have made quite a habit of encouraging people to spend more time playing games.",,False,bad,,,
15,"For example, in my first TED",,True,bad,,,
16,"Talk, I did propose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week, as a planet, playing video games.",,False,bad,,,

18,"It's so much time, in fact, that the number one unsolicited comment that I have heard from people all over the world since I gave that talk, is this: Jane, games are great and all, but on your deathbed, are you really going to wish you spent more time playing Angry Birds?",,True,bad,,,
19,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
20,This idea is so pervasive - that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret - that I hear it literally everywhere I go.,,False,bad,,,
21,"For example, true story: Just a few weeks ago, this cab driver, upon finding out that a friend and I were in town for a game developers' conference, turned around and said - and I quote - ""I hate games.",,True,bad,,,

27,So I have been thinking about this question a lot lately.,,False,bad,,,

30,It's true.,,False,bad,,,

32,And that's what I want to share with you today - the top five regrets of the dying.,,False,bad,,,
33,Number one: I wish I hadn't worked so hard.,,True,bad,,,

39,"For example, I wish I hadn't worked so hard.",,False,bad,,,
40,"For many people, this means, I wish I'd spent more time with my family, with my kids when they were growing up.",,False,bad,,,
41,"Well, we know that playing games together has tremendous family benefits.",,False,bad,,,

57,We're going to come back to this one.,,False,bad,,,
58,"But in the meantime, perhaps you're wondering, who is this game designer to be talking to us about deathbed regrets?",,True,bad,,,
59,"And it's true, I've never worked in a hospice, I've never been on my deathbed.",,False,bad,,,
60,"But recently I did spend three months in bed, wanting to die.",,True,bad,,,
61,Really wanting to die.,,True,bad,,,
62,Now let me tell you that story.,,False,bad,,,
63,"It started two years ago, when I hit my head and got a concussion.",,False,bad,,,
64,"The concussion didn't heal properly, and after 30 days, I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches, nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.",,False,bad,,,
65,"My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain, I had to rest it.",,False,bad,,,
66,So I had to avoid everything that triggered my symptoms.,,False,bad,,,
67,"For me that meant no reading, no writing, no video games, no work or email, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine.",,True,bad,,,
68,In other words - and I think you see where this is going - no reason to live.,,True,bad,,,
69,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
70,"Of course it's meant to be funny, but in all seriousness, suicidal ideation is quite common with traumatic brain injuries.",,True,bad,,,
71,"It happens to one in three, and it happened to me.",,False,bad,,,
72,"My brain started telling me, ""Jane, you want to die.""",,False,bad,,,
73,"It said, ""You're never going to get better.""",,False,bad,,,
74,"It said, ""The pain will never end.""",,False,bad,,,
75,"And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to legitimately fear for my life, which is the time that I said to myself after 34 days - and I will never forget this moment - I said, ""I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game.""",,True,bad,,,
76,"Now, why a game?",,True,bad,,,
77,"I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game - and this is in the scientific literature - we tackle tough challenges with more creativity, more determination, more optimism, and we're more likely to reach out to others for help.",,False,bad,,,
78,"I wanted to bring these gamer traits to my real-life challenge, so I created a role-playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Slayer.",,True,bad,,,
79,"Now this became my new secret identity, and the first thing I did as a slayer was call my twin sister - I have an identical twin sister named Kelly - and tell her, ""I'm playing a game to heal my brain, and I want you to play with me.""",,True,bad,,,
80,This was an easier way to ask for help.,,False,bad,,,
81,"She became my first ally in the game, my husband Kiyash joined next, and together we identified and battled the bad guys.",,False,bad,,,
82,"Now this was anything that could trigger my symptoms and therefore slow down the healing process, things like bright lights and crowded spaces.",,False,bad,,,
83,We also collected and activated power-ups.,,True,bad,,,
84,"This was anything I could do on even my worst day to feel just a little bit good, just a little bit productive.",,False,bad,,,
85,"Things like cuddling my dog for 10 minutes, or getting out of bed and walking around the block just once.",,True,bad,,,
86,Now the game was that simple:,,False,bad,,,
87,"Adopt a secret identity, recruit your allies, battle the bad guys, activate the power-ups.",,False,bad,,,
88,"But even with a game so simple, within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away.",,False,bad,,,
89,It just vanished.,,True,bad,,,
90,It felt like a miracle.,,False,bad,,,
91,Now it wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive symptoms.,,False,bad,,,
92,"That lasted for more than a year, and it was the hardest year of my life by far.",,True,bad,,,
93,"But even when I still had the symptoms, even while I was still in pain, I stopped suffering.",,False,bad,,,
94,Now what happened next with the game surprised me.,,False,bad,,,
95,"I put up some blog posts and videos online, explaining how to play.",,False,bad,,,
96,"But not everybody has a concussion, obviously, not everyone wants to be ""the slayer,"" so I renamed the game SuperBetter.",,True,bad,,,
97,"And soon, I started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity, recruiting their own allies, and they were getting ""super better,"" facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain, depression and Crohn's disease.",,False,bad,,,
98,Even people were playing it for terminal diagnoses like ALS.,,True,bad,,,
99,And I could tell from their messages and their videos that the game was helping them in the same ways that it helped me.,,False,bad,,,
100,They talked about feeling stronger and braver.,,False,bad,,,
101,They talked about feeling better understood by their friends and family.,,False,bad,,,
102,"And they even talked about feeling happier, even though they were in pain, even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives.",,False,bad,,,
103,"Now at the time, I'm thinking to myself, what is going on here?",,True,bad,,,
104,"I mean, how could a game so trivial intervene so powerfully in such serious, and in some cases life-and-death, circumstances?",,False,bad,,,
105,"I mean, if it hadn't worked for me, there's no way I would have believed it was possible.",,True,bad,,,
106,"Well, it turns out there's some science here, too.",,True,bad,,,
107,Some people get stronger and happier after a traumatic event.,,False,bad,,,
108,And that's what was happening to us.,,False,bad,,,
109,"The game was helping us experience what scientists call post-traumatic growth, which is not something we usually hear about.",,True,bad,,,
110,We usually hear about post-traumatic stress disorder.,,False,bad,,,
111,But scientists now know that a traumatic event doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.,,False,bad,,,
112,"Instead, we can use it as a springboard to unleash our best qualities and lead happier lives.",,False,bad,,,
113,"Here are the top five things that people with post-traumatic growth say: ""My priorities have changed.""",,True,bad,,,

121,"It should, because the top five traits of post-traumatic growth are essentially the direct opposite of the top five regrets of the dying.",,True,bad,,,
122,"Now this is interesting, right?",,True,bad,,,
123,"It seems that somehow, a traumatic event can unlock our ability to lead a life with fewer regrets.",,False,bad,,,
124,But how does it work?,,False,bad,,,
125,How do you get from trauma to growth?,,False,bad,,,
126,"Or better yet, is there a way to get all the benefits of post-traumatic growth without the trauma, without having to hit your head in the first place?",,False,bad,,,
127,"That would be good, right?",,True,bad,,,
128,"I wanted to understand the phenomenon better, so I devoured the scientific literature, and here's what I learned.",,False,bad,,,
129,"There are four kinds of strength, or resilience, that contribute to post-traumatic growth, and there are scientifically validated activities that you can do every day to build up these four kinds of resilience, and you don't need a trauma to do it.",,False,bad,,,
130,"I could tell you what these four types of strength are, but I'd rather you experience them firsthand.",,False,bad,,,
131,I'd rather we all start building them up together right now.,,True,bad,,,

133,We'll play a quick game together.,,True,bad,,,
134,This is where you earn the seven and a half minutes of bonus life that I promised you earlier.,,True,bad,,,
135,All you have to do is successfully complete the first four SuperBetter quests.,,False,bad,,,
136,And I feel like you can do it.,,False,bad,,,
137,I have confidence in you.,,False,bad,,,
138,"So, everybody ready?",,True,bad,,,
139,This is your first quest.,,False,bad,,,
140,Here we go.,,True,bad,,,
141,"Pick one: Stand up and take three steps, or make your hands into fists, raise them over your head as high as you can for five seconds, go!",,True,bad,,,

143,You are overachievers.,,True,bad,,,
144,Very good.,,False,bad,,,
145,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
146,"Well done, everyone.",,False,bad,,,
147,"That is worth +1 physical resilience, which means that your body can withstand more stress and heal itself faster.",,False,bad,,,
148,We know from the research that the number one thing you can do to boost your physical resilience is to not sit still.,,True,bad,,,
149,That's all it takes.,,True,bad,,,
150,"Every single second that you are not sitting still, you are actively improving the health of your heart, and your lungs and brains.",,False,bad,,,
151,Everybody ready for your next quest?,,True,bad,,,
152,"I want you to snap your fingers exactly 50 times, or count backwards from 100 by seven, like this: 100, 93...",,True,bad,,,
153,Go! (Snapping),,True,bad,,,

160,Bonus physical resilience.,,False,bad,,,
161,"Well done, everyone.",,False,bad,,,
162,"Now that's worth +1 mental resilience, which means you have more mental focus, more discipline, determination and willpower.",,False,bad,,,
163,We know from the scientific research that willpower actually works like a muscle.,,False,bad,,,
164,It gets stronger the more you exercise it.,,False,bad,,,

166,So good job.,,True,bad,,,
167,Quest number three.,,False,bad,,,
168,"Pick one: Because of the room, fate's really determined this for you, but here are the two options.",,True,bad,,,
169,"If you're inside, find a window and look out of it.",,True,bad,,,

182,Oh!,,True,bad,,,
183,We're clapping for that?,,True,bad,,,
184,That's amazing.,,False,bad,,,
185,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
186,"All right, what we're just feeling there is plus-one emotional resilience, which means you have the ability to provoke powerful, positive emotions like curiosity or love, which we feel looking at baby animals, when you need them most.",,False,bad,,,
187,Here's a secret from the scientific literature for you.,,True,bad,,,
188,"If you can manage to experience three positive emotions for every one negative emotion over the course of an hour, a day, a week, you dramatically improve your health and your ability to successfully tackle any problem you're facing.",,False,bad,,,

203,"Shaking someone's hand for six seconds dramatically raises the level of oxytocin in your bloodstream, now that's the trust hormone.",,True,bad,,,

209,"It turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience - physical, mental, emotional and social - live 10 years longer than everyone else.",,False,bad,,,

21,Somehow I was missing something important.,,False,bad,,,
22,"Now, before I did my residency, I did a master's degree in public health, and one of the things that they teach you in public health school is that if you're a doctor and you see 100 kids that all drink from the same well, and 98 of them develop diarrhea, you can go ahead and write that prescription for dose after dose after dose of antibiotics, or you can walk over and say, ""What the hell is in this well?""",,True,bad,,,

27,The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody needs to know about.,,False,bad,,,
28,"It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser and Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC, and together, they asked 17,500 adults about their history of exposure to what they called ""adverse childhood experiences,"" or ACEs.",,False,bad,,,

33,"Two things: Number one, ACEs are incredibly common.",,False,bad,,,
34,"Sixty-seven percent of the population had at least one ACE, and 12.6 percent, one in eight, had four or more ACEs.",,False,bad,,,
35,"The second thing that they found was that there was a dose-response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes: the higher your ACE score, the worse your health outcomes.",,False,bad,,,
36,"For a person with an ACE score of four or more, their relative risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that of someone with an ACE score of zero.",,False,bad,,,

42,"Some people looked at this data and they said, ""Come on.",,False,bad,,,

44,This isn't science.,,False,bad,,,
45,"This is just bad behavior.""",,True,bad,,,
46,It turns out this is exactly where the science comes in.,,True,bad,,,
47,We now understand better than we ever have before how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains and bodies of children.,,False,bad,,,
48,"It affects areas like the nucleus accumbens, the pleasure and reward center of the brain that is implicated in substance dependence.",,False,bad,,,
49,"It inhibits the prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for impulse control and executive function, a critical area for learning.",,False,bad,,,
50,"And on MRI scans, we see measurable differences in the amygdala, the brain's fear response center.",,False,bad,,,
51,"So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed to high doses of adversity are more likely to engage in high-risk behavior, and that's important to know.",,False,bad,,,
52,"But it turns out that even if you don't engage in any high-risk behavior, you're still more likely to develop heart disease or cancer.",,False,bad,,,
53,"The reason for this has to do with the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the brain's and body's stress response system that governs our fight-or-flight response.",,False,bad,,,
54,How does it work?,,False,bad,,,
55,"Well, imagine you're walking in the forest and you see a bear.",,True,bad,,,
56,"Immediately, your hypothalamus sends a signal to your pituitary, which sends a signal to your adrenal gland that says, ""Release stress hormones!",,True,bad,,,
57,"Adrenaline! Cortisol!""",,False,bad,,,

59,And that is wonderful if you're in a forest and there's a bear.,,True,bad,,,
60,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
61,"But the problem is what happens when the bear comes home every night, and this system is activated over and over and over again, and it goes from being adaptive, or life-saving, to maladaptive, or health-damaging.",,False,bad,,,
62,"Children are especially sensitive to this repeated stress activation, because their brains and bodies are just developing.",,False,bad,,,
63,"High doses of adversity not only affect brain structure and function, they affect the developing immune system, developing hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA is read and transcribed.",,False,bad,,,
64,"So for me, this information threw my old training out the window, because when we understand the mechanism of a disease, when we know not only which pathways are disrupted, but how, then as doctors, it is our job to use this science for prevention and treatment.",,False,bad,,,
65,That's what we do.,,False,bad,,,
66,"So in San Francisco, we created the Center for Youth Wellness to prevent, screen and heal the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress.",,False,bad,,,
67,"We started simply with routine screening of every one of our kids at their regular physical, because I know that if my patient has an ACE score of 4, she's two and a half times as likely to develop hepatitis or COPD, she's four and half times as likely to become depressed, and she's 12 times as likely to attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero ACEs.",,False,bad,,,
68,I know that when she's in my exam room.,,True,bad,,,
69,"For our patients who do screen positive, we have a multidisciplinary treatment team that works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices, including home visits, care coordination, mental health care, nutrition, holistic interventions, and yes, medication when necessary.",,False,bad,,,
70,"But we also educate parents about the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering electrical outlets, or lead poisoning, and we tailor the care of our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may need more aggressive treatment, given the changes to their hormonal and immune systems.",,False,bad,,,
71,"So the other thing that happens when you understand this science is that you want to shout it from the rooftops, because this isn't just an issue for kids in Bayview.",,False,bad,,,
72,"I figured the minute that everybody else heard about this, it would be routine screening, multi-disciplinary treatment teams, and it would be a race to the most effective clinical treatment protocols.",,False,bad,,,
73,Yeah.,,True,bad,,,
74,That did not happen.,,True,bad,,,
75,And that was a huge learning for me.,,False,bad,,,
76,What I had thought of as simply best clinical practice I now understand to be a movement.,,False,bad,,,
77,"In the words of Dr. Robert Block, the former President of the American Academy of Pediatrics, ""Adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest unaddressed public health threat facing our nation today.""",,False,bad,,,

79,The scope and scale of the problem seems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it.,,False,bad,,,
80,"But for me, that's actually where the hopes lies, because when we have the right framework, when we recognize this to be a public health crisis, then we can begin to use the right tool kit to come up with solutions.",,False,bad,,,
81,"From tobacco to lead poisoning to HIV/AIDS, the United States actually has quite a strong track record with addressing public health problems, but replicating those successes with ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination and commitment, and when I look at what our nation's response has been so far, I wonder, why haven't we taken this more seriously?",,False,bad,,,
82,"You know, at first I thought that we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us.",,False,bad,,,
83,That's an issue for those kids in those neighborhoods.,,False,bad,,,

85,"The original ACEs study was done in a population that was 70 percent Caucasian, 70 percent college-educated.",,False,bad,,,

4,"You know, I don't know how many of those you read, but it's not fun to read and often not fun to write - even worse to write.",,True,bad,,,
5,So I decided to try and write something more fun.,,False,bad,,,

26,And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways.,,False,bad,,,
27,"First of all, I enjoyed writing.",,False,bad,,,
28,But the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people.,,False,bad,,,
29,"It's a fantastic time to write, because there's so much feedback you can get from people.",,False,bad,,,
30,"People write to me about their personal experience, and about their examples, and where they disagree, and their nuances.",,False,bad,,,
31,"And even being here - I mean, the last few days, I've known heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about.",,True,bad,,,
32,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
33,Which I think is just fascinating.,,True,bad,,,
34,"I will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior, and I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality.",,False,bad,,,
35,So think about these two tables.,,False,bad,,,
36,And you must have seen this illusion.,,True,bad,,,
37,"If I asked you what's longer, the vertical line on the table on the left, or the horizontal line on the table on the right, which one seems longer?",,True,bad,,,
38,Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer?,,True,bad,,,
39,"No, right?",,True,bad,,,
40,It's impossible.,,False,bad,,,
41,But the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.,,False,bad,,,
42,So I can put some lines on; it doesn't help.,,True,bad,,,
43,I can animate the lines.,,False,bad,,,
44,"And to the extent you believe I didn't shrink the lines, which I didn't, I've proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you.",,False,bad,,,

47,"You can't look at this and say, ""Now I see reality as it is.""",,False,bad,,,
48,Right?,,True,bad,,,
49,It's impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer.,,False,bad,,,
50,"Our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable, predictable, consistent way.",,False,bad,,,
51,"and there is almost nothing we can do about it, aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it.",,False,bad,,,
52,Here's another one.,,False,bad,,,
53,It's one of my favorite illusions.,,True,bad,,,
54,What color is the top arrow pointing to?,,False,bad,,,
55,Audience: Brown.,,True,bad,,,
56,Dan Ariely: Brown.,,True,bad,,,
57,Thank you.,,False,bad,,,
58,The bottom one?,,False,bad,,,

60,Turns out they're identical.,,True,bad,,,
61,Can anybody see them as identical?,,False,bad,,,
62,"Very, very hard.",,False,bad,,,
63,I can cover the rest of the cube up.,,True,bad,,,

65,"If you don't believe me, you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see that they're identical.",,True,bad,,,
66,"But again, it's the same story, that if we take the background away, the illusion comes back.",,False,bad,,,
67,There is no way for us not to see this illusion.,,False,bad,,,
68,"I guess maybe if you're colorblind, I don't think you can see that.",,True,bad,,,
69,I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor.,,False,bad,,,
70,Vision is one of the best things we do.,,False,bad,,,
71,We have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision - bigger than dedicated to anything else.,,False,bad,,,
72,We use our vision more hours of the day than anything else.,,False,bad,,,
73,We're evolutionarily designed to use vision.,,False,bad,,,
74,"And if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision, which we're so good at, what are the chances we won't make even more mistakes in something we're not as good at, for example, financial decision-making.",,True,bad,,,
75,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
76,"Something we don't have an evolutionary reason to do, we don't have a specialized part of the brain for, and we don't do that many hours of the day.",,False,bad,,,
77,"The argument is in those cases, it might be that we actually make many more mistakes.",,False,bad,,,
78,"And worse - not having an easy way to see them, because in visual illusions, we can easily demonstrate the mistakes; in cognitive illusion it's much, much harder to demonstrate the mistakes to people.",,False,bad,,,
79,"So I want to show you some cognitive illusions, or decision-making illusions, in the same way.",,False,bad,,,
80,And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences.,,True,bad,,,
81,It's from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein.,,False,bad,,,
82,It basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in donating their organs.,,True,bad,,,
83,These are different countries in Europe.,,False,bad,,,
84,"You basically see two types of countries: countries on the right, that seem to be giving a lot; and countries on the left that seem to giving very little, or much less.",,False,bad,,,
85,"The question is, why?",,False,bad,,,
86,Why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little?,,False,bad,,,
87,"When you ask people this question, they usually think that it has to be about culture.",,False,bad,,,
88,How much do you care about people?,,False,bad,,,
89,"Giving organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society, how linked you are.",,False,bad,,,
90,Or maybe it's about religion.,,False,bad,,,
91,"But if you look at this plot, you can see that countries that we think about as very similar, actually exhibit very different behavior.",,False,bad,,,
92,"For example, Sweden is all the way on the right, and Denmark, which we think is culturally very similar, is all the way on the left.",,True,bad,,,
93,"Germany is on the left, and Austria is on the right.",,True,bad,,,
94,"The Netherlands is on the left, and Belgium is on the right.",,False,bad,,,
95,"And finally, depending on your particular version of European similarity, you can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not, but it turns out that with organ donation, they are very different.",,True,bad,,,
96,"By the way, the Netherlands is an interesting story.",,True,bad,,,
97,"You see, the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group.",,True,bad,,,
98,"It turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter, begging people to join this organ donation program.",,True,bad,,,
99,"You know the expression, ""Begging only gets you so far.""",,True,bad,,,
100,It's 28 percent in organ donation.,,False,bad,,,
101,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
102,"But whatever the countries on the right are doing, they're doing a much better job than begging.",,True,bad,,,
103,So what are they doing?,,True,bad,,,
104,Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV.,,True,bad,,,
105,And here is the story.,,False,bad,,,
106,The countries on the left have a form at the DMV that looks something like this.,,True,bad,,,
107,"""Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program.""",,True,bad,,,
108,And what happens?,,True,bad,,,
109,"People don't check, and they don't join.",,False,bad,,,
110,"The countries on the right, the ones that give a lot, have a slightly different form.",,True,bad,,,
111,"It says, ""Check the box below if you don't want to participate ...""",,True,bad,,,
112,"Interestingly enough, when people get this, they again don't check, but now they join.",,True,bad,,,
113,"(Laughter) Now, think about what this means.",,False,bad,,,
114,"You know, we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions.",,False,bad,,,
115,We wake up in the morning and we open the closet; we feel that we decide what to wear.,,True,bad,,,
116,we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat.,,False,bad,,,
117,"What this is actually saying, is that many of these decisions are not residing within us.",,False,bad,,,
118,They are residing in the person who is designing that form.,,False,bad,,,
119,"When you walk into the DMV, the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you'll end up doing.",,False,bad,,,
120,"Now, it's also very hard to intuit these results.",,False,bad,,,
121,Think about it for yourself.,,False,bad,,,
122,"How many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow, and you went to the DMV, and you encountered one of these forms, that it would actually change your own behavior?",,False,bad,,,
123,Very hard to think that it would influence us.,,False,bad,,,
124,"We can say, ""Oh, these funny Europeans, of course it would influence them.""",,True,bad,,,
125,"But when it comes to us, we have such a feeling that we're in the driver's seat, such a feeling that we're in control and we are making the decision, that it's very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision, rather than an actual decision.",,False,bad,,,
126,"Now, you might say, ""These are decisions we don't care about.""",,False,bad,,,
127,"In fact, by definition, these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die.",,False,bad,,,
128,How could we care about something less than about something that happens after we die?,,False,bad,,,
129,"So a standard economist, somebody who believes in rationality, would say, ""You know what?",,True,bad,,,
130,"The cost of lifting the pencil and marking a ""V"" is higher than the possible benefit of the decision, so that's why we get this effect.""",,False,bad,,,
131,"(Laughter) But, in fact, it's not because it's easy.",,True,bad,,,
132,It's not because it's trivial.,,False,bad,,,
133,It's not because we don't care.,,True,bad,,,
134,It's the opposite.,,False,bad,,,
135,It's because we care.,,True,bad,,,
136,It's difficult and it's complex.,,False,bad,,,
137,And it's so complex that we don't know what to do.,,False,bad,,,
138,"And because we have no idea what to do, we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us.",,False,bad,,,
139,I'll give you one more example.,,False,bad,,,
140,This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Shafir.,,False,bad,,,
141,"And they said, ""Would this effect also happens to experts?",,True,bad,,,
142,"People who are well-paid, experts in their decisions, and who make a lot of them?""",,False,bad,,,
143,And they took a group of physicians.,,False,bad,,,
144,They presented to them a case study of a patient.,,False,bad,,,
145,"They said, ""Here is a patient.",,False,bad,,,
146,He is a 67-year-old farmer.,,False,bad,,,
147,"He's been suffering from right hip pain for a while.""",,False,bad,,,
148,"And then, they said to the physicians, ""You decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient.",,False,bad,,,
149,"All these medications, nothing seems to be working.",,False,bad,,,
150,So you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy.,,False,bad,,,
151,Hip replacement.,,False,bad,,,
152,"Okay?""",,False,bad,,,
153,So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced.,,False,bad,,,
154,"Then they said to half of the physicians, ""Yesterday, you reviewed the patient's case, and you realized that you forgot to try one medication.",,True,bad,,,
155,You did not try ibuprofen.,,True,bad,,,
156,What do you do?,,True,bad,,,
157,Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen?,,True,bad,,,
158,"Or do you let him go and have hip replacement?""",,True,bad,,,
159,"Well, the good news is that most physicians in this case decided to pull the patient and try ibuprofen.",,True,bad,,,
160,Very good for the physicians.,,True,bad,,,
161,"To the other group of physicians, they said, ""Yesterday when you reviewed the case, you discovered there were two medications you didn't try out yet - ibuprofen and piroxicam.""",,True,bad,,,
162,You have two medications you didn't try out yet.,,False,bad,,,
163,What do you do?,,True,bad,,,
164,"You let him go, or you pull him back?",,False,bad,,,
165,"And if you pull him back, do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam?",,True,bad,,,
166,"Which one?""",,False,bad,,,
167,"Now, think of it:",,False,bad,,,
168,"This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement, but pulling him back, all of the sudden it becomes more complex.",,False,bad,,,
169,There is one more decision.,,False,bad,,,
170,What happens now?,,True,bad,,,
171,The majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go for a hip replacement.,,False,bad,,,
172,"I hope this worries you, by the way - (Laughter) when you go to see your physician.",,True,bad,,,
173,"The thing is that no physician would ever say, ""Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement.",,True,bad,,,
174,"Let's go for hip replacement.""",,True,bad,,,
175,"But the moment you set this as the default, it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing.",,False,bad,,,
176,I'll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making.,,False,bad,,,
177,Imagine I give you a choice:,,False,bad,,,
178,"Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome, all expenses paid - hotel, transportation, food, a continental breakfast, everything - or a weekend in Paris?",,True,bad,,,
179,"Now, weekend in Paris, weekend in Rome - these are different things.",,False,bad,,,
180,"They have different food, different culture, different art.",,False,bad,,,
181,Imagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted.,,False,bad,,,
182,"Imagine I said, ""A weekend in Rome, a weekend in Paris, or having your car stolen?"" (Laughter)",,True,bad,,,
183,"It's a funny idea, because why would having your car stolen, in this set, influence anything?",,True,bad,,,
184,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
185,But what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this?,,True,bad,,,
186,"What if it was a trip to Rome, all expenses paid, transportation, breakfast, but it doesn't include coffee in the morning?",,True,bad,,,
187,"If you want coffee, you have to pay for it yourself, it's two euros 50.",,True,bad,,,
188,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
189,"Now in some ways, given that you can have Rome with coffee, why would you possibly want Rome without coffee?",,True,bad,,,
190,It's like having your car stolen.,,True,bad,,,
191,It's an inferior option.,,True,bad,,,
192,But guess what happened?,,True,bad,,,
193,"The moment you add Rome without coffee, Rome with coffee becomes more popular, and people choose it.",,True,bad,,,
194,"The fact that you have Rome without coffee makes Rome with coffee look superior, and not just to Rome without coffee - even superior to Paris.",,True,bad,,,
195,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
196,Here are two examples of this principle.,,False,bad,,,
197,"This was an ad in The Economist a few years ago that gave us three choices: an online subscription for 59 dollars, a print subscription for 125 dollars, or you could get both for 125.",,True,bad,,,
198,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
199,"Now I looked at this, and I called up The Economist, and I tried to figure out what they were thinking.",,True,bad,,,
200,"And they passed me from one person to another to another, until eventually I got to the person who was in charge of the website, and I called them up, and they went to check what was going on.",,False,bad,,,
201,"The next thing I know, the ad is gone, no explanation.",,True,bad,,,
202,So I decided to do the experiment that I would have loved The Economist to do with me.,,True,bad,,,
203,I took this and I gave it to 100 MIT students.,,False,bad,,,
204,"I said, ""What would you choose?""",,False,bad,,,
205,These are the market shares - most people wanted the combo deal.,,True,bad,,,
206,"Thankfully, nobody wanted the dominant option.",,False,bad,,,
207,That means our students can read.,,True,bad,,,
208,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
209,"But now, if you have an option that nobody wants, you can take it off, right?",,False,bad,,,
210,"So I printed another version of this, where I eliminated the middle option.",,True,bad,,,
211,I gave it to another 100 students.,,False,bad,,,
212,Here is what happened:,,True,bad,,,
213,"Now the most popular option became the least popular, and the least popular became the most popular.",,False,bad,,,
214,"What was happening was the option that was useless, in the middle, was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it.",,False,bad,,,
215,But it wasn't useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted.,,False,bad,,,
216,"In fact, relative to the option in the middle, which was get only the print for 125, the print and web for 125 looked like a fantastic deal.",,True,bad,,,
217,"And as a consequence, people chose it.",,False,bad,,,
218,"The general idea here, by the way, is that we actually don't know our preferences that well.",,True,bad,,,
219,"And because we don't know our preferences that well, we're susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces: the defaults, the particular options that are presented to us, and so on.",,False,bad,,,
220,One more example of this.,,False,bad,,,
221,"People believe that when we deal with physical attraction, we see somebody, and we know immediately whether we like them or not, if we're attracted or not.",,True,bad,,,
222,This is why we have these four-minute dates.,,False,bad,,,
223,So I decided to do this experiment with people.,,False,bad,,,
224,"I'll show you images here, no real people, but the experiment was with people.",,False,bad,,,
225,"I showed some people a picture of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.",,True,bad,,,
226,"and I said, ""Who do you want to date?",,True,bad,,,
227,"Tom or Jerry?""",,True,bad,,,
228,"But for half the people, I added an ugly version of Jerry.",,True,bad,,,
229,I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive.,,True,bad,,,
230,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
231,"For the other people, I added an ugly version of Tom.",,True,bad,,,
232,"And the question was, will ugly Jerry and ugly",,True,bad,,,
233,"Tom help their respective, more attractive brothers?",,True,bad,,,
234,The answer was absolutely yes.,,False,bad,,,
235,"When ugly Jerry was around, Jerry was popular.",,True,bad,,,
236,"When ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.",,True,bad,,,
237,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
238,This of course has two very clear implications for life in general.,,False,bad,,,
239,"If you ever go bar-hopping, who do you want to take with you?",,True,bad,,,
240,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
241,You want a slightly uglier version of yourself.,,True,bad,,,
242,"(Laughter) Similar, but slightly uglier.",,True,bad,,,
243,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
244,"The second point, or course, is that if somebody invites you to bar hop, you know what they think about you.",,True,bad,,,
245,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
246,Now you get it.,,True,bad,,,
247,What is the general point?,,False,bad,,,
248,"The general point is that, when we think about economics, we have this beautiful view of human nature.",,False,bad,,,
249,"""What a piece of work is a man!",,False,bad,,,
250,"How noble in reason!""",,False,bad,,,
251,"We have this view of ourselves, of others.",,False,bad,,,
252,"The behavioral economics perspective is slightly less ""generous"" to people; in fact, in medical terms, that's our view.",,False,bad,,,
253,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,
254,But there is a silver lining.,,False,bad,,,
255,"The silver lining is, I think, kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting.",,False,bad,,,
256,"Are we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson?",,True,bad,,,
257,"When it comes to building the physical world, we kind of understand our limitations.",,False,bad,,,
258,We build steps.,,False,bad,,,
259,"And we build these things that not everybody can use, obviously.",,False,bad,,,
260,(Laughter),,True,bad,,,

57,"I always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education, number one; basketball was second, because it was paying their way, and they do need a little time for social activities, but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two, and you're not going to have any very long.",,False,bad,,,

65,"I had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of, Bill Walton.",,False,bad,,,
66,He came to catch the bus; we were leaving for somewhere to play.,,False,bad,,,

68,"He couldn't get on the bus, he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport.",,False,bad,,,
69,So I was a stickler for that.,,True,bad,,,
70,I believed in that.,,False,bad,,,
71,I believe in time; very important.,,False,bad,,,
72,"I believe you should be on time, but I felt at practice, for example - we start on time, we close on time.",,False,bad,,,
73,The youngsters didn't have to feel that we were going to keep them over.,,False,bad,,,

110,"I worked on this for some 14 years, and I think it helped me become a better teacher.",,False,bad,,,

116,You'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head at various times.,,True,bad,,,

120,"He said, ""Sometimes I think the Fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we can't win, is the Fates themselves have missed.",,False,bad,,,

143,"That's what really matters: if you make an effort to do the best you can regularly, the results will be about what they should be.",,False,bad,,,
144,Not necessarily what you'd want them to be but they'll be about what they should; only you will know whether you can do that.,,False,bad,,,
145,And that's what I wanted from them more than anything else.,,False,bad,,,
146,"And as time went by, and I learned more about other things, I think it worked a little better, as far as the results.",,False,bad,,,
147,"But I wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things, and not the end itself.",,False,bad,,,
148,"I believe it was one great philosopher who said - no, no - Cervantes.",,True,bad,,,

184,Neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well.,,True,bad,,,

189,"They weren't very quick, but they played good position, kept in good balance.",,False,bad,,,

191,So they had qualities that - they came close to - as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players I ever had.,,False,bad,,,

11,And I noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space had already automated my job role.,,True,bad,,,
12,And this is right about when I got this sage advice to build up my resume.,,False,bad,,,
13,"Well, as I'm trying to figure out what two-story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up, I read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett, and he said, ""Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age.""",,True,bad,,,

36,"And that later became what I now call Live Your Legend, which I'll explain in a little bit.",,True,bad,,,

25,That's what happened with my brother.,,True,bad,,,
26,Even making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior.,,True,bad,,,
27,But sometimes we're too weak.,,False,bad,,,

29,"And this range of acceptable behaviors - when we stay within our range, we're rewarded.",,False,bad,,,
30,"When we step outside that range, we get punished in a variety of ways.",,False,bad,,,

34,What is my range?,,False,bad,,,
35,"But the key thing is, our range isn't fixed; it's actually pretty dynamic.",,False,bad,,,
36,It expands and it narrows based on the context.,,False,bad,,,
37,"And there's one thing that determines that range more than anything else, and that's your power.",,False,bad,,,
38,Your power determines your range.,,False,bad,,,
39,What is power?,,False,bad,,,
40,Power comes in lots of forms.,,False,bad,,,
41,"In negotiations, it comes in the form of alternatives.",,False,bad,,,
42,So my brother had no alternatives; he lacked power.,,False,bad,,,
43,The company had lots of alternatives; they had power.,,False,bad,,,
44,"Sometimes it's being new to a country, like an immigrant, or new to an organization or new to an experience, like my wife and I as new parents.",,False,bad,,,

46,"Sometimes it's in relationships, where one person's more invested than the other person.",,False,bad,,,
47,"And the key thing is that when we have lots of power, our range is very wide.",,False,bad,,,
48,We have a lot of leeway in how to behave.,,False,bad,,,
49,"But when we lack power, our range narrows.",,False,bad,,,
50,We have very little leeway.,,False,bad,,,
51,"The problem is that when our range narrows, that produces something called the low-power double bind.",,False,bad,,,
52,"The low-power double bind happens when, if we don't speak up, we go unnoticed, but if we do speak up, we get punished.",,True,bad,,,
53,"Now, many of you have heard the phrase the ""double bind"" and connected it with one thing, and that's gender.",,False,bad,,,
54,"The gender double bind is women who don't speak up go unnoticed, and women who do speak up get punished.",,False,bad,,,
55,"And the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up, but they have barriers to doing so.",,False,bad,,,
56,"But what my research has shown over the last two decades is that what looks like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind, it's a really a low-power double bind.",,False,bad,,,
57,And what looks like a gender difference are really often just power differences in disguise.,,False,bad,,,
58,"Oftentimes we see a difference between a man and a woman or men and women, and think, ""Biological cause.",,False,bad,,,
59,"There's something fundamentally different about the sexes.""",,True,bad,,,
60,"But in study after study, I've found that a better explanation for many sex differences is really power.",,False,bad,,,
61,And so it's the low-power double bind.,,False,bad,,,
62,"And the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range, and we lack power.",,False,bad,,,
63,"We have a narrow range, and our double bind is very large.",,False,bad,,,
64,So we need to find ways to expand our range.,,False,bad,,,
65,"And over the last couple decades, my colleagues and I have found two things really matter.",,False,bad,,,
66,The first: you seem powerful in your own eyes.,,False,bad,,,
67,The second: you seem powerful in the eyes of others.,,False,bad,,,
68,"When I feel powerful, I feel confident, not fearful; I expand my own range.",,False,bad,,,
69,"When other people see me as powerful, they grant me a wider range.",,False,bad,,,
70,So we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior.,,False,bad,,,
71,And I'm going to give you a set of tools today.,,False,bad,,,
72,"Speaking up is risky, but these tools will lower your risk of speaking up.",,True,bad,,,
73,The first tool I'm going to give you got discovered in negotiations in an important finding.,,False,bad,,,
74,"On average, women make less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table.",,False,bad,,,
75,But Hannah Riley Bowles and Emily Amanatullah have discovered there's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious.,,False,bad,,,
76,That's when they advocate for others.,,True,bad,,,
77,"When they advocate for others, they discover their own range and expand it in their own mind.",,False,bad,,,
78,They become more assertive.,,True,bad,,,
79,"This is sometimes called ""the mama bear effect.""",,True,bad,,,
80,"Like a mama bear defending her cubs, when we advocate for others, we can discover our own voice.",,False,bad,,,
81,"But sometimes, we have to advocate for ourselves.",,False,bad,,,
82,How do we do that?,,False,bad,,,
83,One of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective-taking.,,False,bad,,,
84,And perspective-taking is really simple: it's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person.,,False,bad,,,
85,It's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range.,,False,bad,,,
86,"When I take your perspective, and I think about what you really want, you're more likely to give me what I really want.",,False,bad,,,
87,But here's the problem: perspective-taking is hard to do.,,False,bad,,,
88,So let's do a little experiment.,,False,bad,,,
89,I want you all to hold your hand just like this: your finger - put it up.,,True,bad,,,
90,And I want you to draw a capital letter E on your forehead as quickly as possible.,,True,bad,,,
91,"OK, it turns out that we can draw this E in one of two ways, and this was originally designed as a test of perspective-taking.",,False,bad,,,
92,"I'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an E on their forehead - my former student, Erika Hall.",,False,bad,,,
93,"And you can see over here, that's the correct E. I drew the E so it looks like an E to another person.",,True,bad,,,
94,That's the perspective-taking E because it looks like an E from someone else's vantage point.,,True,bad,,,
95,But this E over here is the self-focused E.,,False,bad,,,
96,We often get self-focused.,,False,bad,,,
97,And we particularly get self-focused in a crisis.,,False,bad,,,
98,I want to tell you about a particular crisis.,,False,bad,,,
99,"A man walks into a bank in Watsonville, California.",,False,bad,,,
100,"And he says, ""Give me $2,000, or I'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb.""",,True,bad,,,

102,She took a step back.,,False,bad,,,
103,"She took his perspective, and she noticed something really important.",,False,bad,,,
104,He asked for a specific amount of money.,,False,bad,,,
105,"So she said, ""Why did you ask for $2,000?""",,True,bad,,,
106,"And he said, ""My friend is going to be evicted unless I get him $2,000 immediately.""",,True,bad,,,
107,"And she said, ""Oh!",,True,bad,,,

109,"(Laughter) ""Why don't you come back to my office, and we can have you fill out the paperwork.""",,True,bad,,,
110,"(Laughter) Now, her quick perspective-taking defused a volatile situation.",,False,bad,,,
111,"So when we take someone's perspective, it allows us to be ambitious and assertive, but still be likable.",,False,bad,,,
112,"Here's another way to be assertive but still be likable, and that is to signal flexibility.",,False,bad,,,
113,"Now, imagine you're a car salesperson, and you want to sell someone a car.",,True,bad,,,
114,You're going to more likely make the sale if you give them two options.,,False,bad,,,
115,"Let's say option A: $24,000 for this car and a five-year warranty.",,True,bad,,,
116,"Or option B: $23,000 and a three-year warranty.",,True,bad,,,
117,"My research shows that when you give people a choice among options, it lowers their defenses, and they're more likely to accept your offer.",,False,bad,,,
118,And this doesn't just work with salespeople; it works with parents.,,False,bad,,,
119,"When my niece was four, she resisted getting dressed and rejected everything.",,False,bad,,,

122,This shirt or that shirt?,,True,bad,,,
123,"OK, that shirt.",,True,bad,,,
124,This pant or that pant?,,True,bad,,,
125,"OK, that pant.",,True,bad,,,
126,And it worked brilliantly.,,False,bad,,,
127,She got dressed quickly and without resistance.,,False,bad,,,
128,"When I've asked the question around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up, the number one answer is: ""When I have social support in my audience; when I have allies.""",,False,bad,,,
129,So we want to get allies on our side.,,False,bad,,,
130,How do we do that?,,False,bad,,,
131,"Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear.",,True,bad,,,
132,"When we advocate for others, we expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others, but we also earn strong allies.",,False,bad,,,
133,"Another way we can earn strong allies, especially in high places, is by asking other people for advice.",,False,bad,,,
134,"When we ask others for advice, they like us because we flatter them, and we're expressing humility.",,False,bad,,,
135,And this really works to solve another double bind.,,False,bad,,,
136,And that's the self-promotion double bind.,,True,bad,,,
137,"The self-promotion double bind is that if we don't advertise our accomplishments, no one notices.",,True,bad,,,
138,"And if we do, we're not likable.",,False,bad,,,
139,"But if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments, we are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable.",,False,bad,,,
140,And this is so powerful it even works when you see it coming.,,True,bad,,,
141,There have been multiple times in life when I have been forewarned that a low-power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice.,,False,bad,,,
142,I want you to notice three things about this:,,False,bad,,,
143,"First, I knew they were going to come ask me for advice.",,False,bad,,,
144,"Two, I've actually done research on the strategic benefits of asking for advice.",,False,bad,,,
145,"And three, it still worked!",,True,bad,,,
146,"I took their perspective, I became more invested in their cause, I became more committed to them because they asked for advice.",,False,bad,,,
147,"Now, another time we feel more confident speaking up is when we have expertise.",,False,bad,,,
148,Expertise gives us credibility.,,False,bad,,,
149,"When we have high power, we already have credibility.",,False,bad,,,
150,We only need good evidence.,,False,bad,,,
151,"When we lack power, we don't have the credibility.",,False,bad,,,
152,We need excellent evidence.,,False,bad,,,
153,And one of the ways we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion.,,False,bad,,,
154,"I want everyone in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them, ""I want you to describe a passion of yours to me.""",,True,bad,,,
155,"I've had people do this all over the world and I asked them, ""What did you notice about the other person when they described their passion?""",,False,bad,,,

165,"I leaned in.""",,True,bad,,,
166,"When we tap into our passion, we give ourselves the courage, in our own eyes, to speak up, but we also get the permission from others to speak up.",,False,bad,,,
