1,I know what you're thinking.,False,False,good,,,,,,
2,We're going to laugh at that monkey aren't we?,True,True,good,,,,,,
3,"And yes, we certainly are.",False,False,good,,,,,,
4,But you should know the monkeys are laughing right back at you.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
5,What with your little floppy ass?,True,True,good,,,,,,
6,"Well, we'll get to that.",False,False,good,,,,,,
7,"But first, let me tell you about these monkeys.",False,False,good,,,,,,
8,"This is the Probossus Monkey, which has a very unusual feet, or I'd say it has a big nose.",False,False,good,,,,,,
9,"Like, rest on your chin you could teabag yourself sort of nose.",True,True,good,,,,,,
10,"It is out of proportion compared to our proportions anyway, and we find that funny.",False,False,good,,,,,,
11,"In nerd, the Probossus monkey is called Nezellus Lervatus, which roughly translates to nose like a mask.",False,False,good,,,,,,
12,And the person who named it that probably dressed up as a dick for Halloween.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
13,"You know, like they had a mask that looked like a- well you get it.",False,False,good,,,,,,
14,"In any case, the Probossus Monkey is part of a group of monkeys called the Ardnosed Colibines.",False,False,good,,,,,,
15,"Another monkey in that group is Rhino Pythagus, which roughly translates to nose monkey.",False,False,good,,,,,,
16,A name given to a monkey that barely has a nose at all.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
17,This snub-nosed monkey can look a bit like it snorted lots of cocaine through a pair of scissors.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
18,But it's not a nut-nosed though.,False,False,good,,,,,,
19,From the side you can see it's just very small and upturned.,False,False,good,,,,,,
20,"Sure, I think it's a bit messed up to single out a few related monkeys and call them Ardnosed.",False,False,good,,,,,,
21,But characterizing monkeys by their noses is apparently the hot thing to do for the science hippies.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
22,Monkeys are basically divided into two main groups- Platarini and Catarini.,False,False,good,,,,,,
23,Platarini means flat nose.,False,False,good,,,,,,
24,"These are the new world monkeys who often have sideways facing wide-sit nostrils, like squirrel monkeys or tamarins.",False,False,good,,,,,,
25,Catarini means down-nosed.,False,False,good,,,,,,
26,"And these are the old world monkeys, including macaques and apes.",False,False,good,,,,,,
27,"And the mandrel, which at least deserves a runner-up in the Ardnosed category.",False,False,good,,,,,,
28,"I mean, it looks like it re-rendered a unicorn that was stopped at a traffic light.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
29,All the way up to the eyes.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
30,The Prabasas monkey is a down-nosed monkey that took the concept and just ran with it.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
31,"In males, the external portion of their nose, the part that is outside the skull, can grow so large you can't play got your nose with them.",False,False,good,,,,,,
32,You'd have to use your whole fist.,False,False,good,,,,,,
33,"They don't have to cut their hands to smell their breath though, and that's a plus.",False,False,good,,,,,,
34,"But listen, there's someone else in the down-nosed group with an unusually big external nose.",False,False,good,,,,,,
35,The second biggest.,False,False,good,,,,,,
36,It's us.,False,False,good,,,,,,
37,I know what you're thinking.,False,False,good,,,,,,
38,My nose isn't that big.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
39,Of course it is.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
40,Look at that fleshy pyramid sticking out like that.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
41,"I mean, come on, we have to tilt our friggin head to the side when we want a kiss.",True,True,good,,,,,,
42,Snub-nosed monkey can kiss straight on no problem.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
43,"I mean, if one of them sneezes, the other one might toot a little, but that's alright.",True,True,good,,,,,,
44,"I'm telling you, we look hilarious.",True,True,good,,,,,,
45,What?,False,False,good,,,,,,
46,"No, Jerry, I'm not going to talk about the erections.",True,True,good,,,,,,
47,Yet.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
48,"Now, the male Prabasas monkeys profound mezality is most likely the result of sexual selection, which is the corner of evolution where all the weird shit happens.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
49,There are a couple ways it can go down.,False,False,good,,,,,,
50,One way is driven by how females decide which male to get busy with.,False,False,good,,,,,,
51,"For example, let's take these birds here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
52,Let's say a female has a gene that makes her attracted to a longer tail.,False,False,good,,,,,,
53,Now she gets out there and gets down with a longer tailed male.,False,False,good,,,,,,
54,Now the gene for longer tailed males and the gene for being attracted to longer tailed males get passed on.,False,False,good,,,,,,
55,And now you've got males with longer tails.,False,False,good,,,,,,
56,"But if females are attracted to longer tails, then she's going to choose males with longer longer tails.",False,False,good,,,,,,
57,But that on repeat and see what happens.,False,False,good,,,,,,
58,In the case of the sacraboli you wind up with more tail and bird.,False,False,good,,,,,,
59,"Congrats, you're a sexy bird now, but you have the flying style of a floppy trash bag that's been caught in a whirl of wind.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
60,These outsized male ornaments can also become linked to other favorable traits.,False,False,good,,,,,,
61,In the sense that a peacock's tail might give you clues about the peacock's fuck,True,False,bad,,,,,,
62,"Well, if it had one, but you get the point, even if the p-hen doesn't.",False,False,good,,,,,,
63,Glowaca jokes.,False,False,good,,,,,,
64,"In the case of the probasus male, a large nose is correlated to a larger body mass and larger testicular size.",False,False,good,,,,,,
65,And that means more sperm and a greater chance of getting pricked.,False,False,good,,,,,,
66,"But listen, monkeys are naked and it's not that hard to see how big they are and how big their testicles are, especially with the whole erection thing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
67,But it's not time for that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
68,"Yet, I know what you're thinking, sweaty nipples.",True,True,good,,,,,,
69,Maybe our unusually large human noses correlate to the size of something else on our bodies.,False,False,good,,,,,,
70,Is the size of our nose related to the size of another sticking out bit?,False,False,good,,,,,,
71,"Well, let me tell you.",False,False,good,,,,,,
72,"Just last year there was a study in Japan where the science hippies took a bunch of dead people, pretty sure they were dead already, and what they did was measure their noses, and then compared that to their SPL or stretched penis length, which is apparently some sort of standard way of measuring a penis.",False,False,good,,,,,,
73,"News to me, I've been doing it all wrong, and what they found were that the two measurements were highly related.",False,False,good,,,,,,
74,A bigger nose meant a bigger SPL.,False,False,good,,,,,,
75,"Now that's not to suggest that our noses are the product of female choice sexual selection, and that might only be part of the story with the pervasus monkey.",False,False,good,,,,,,
76,But female choice isn't the only flavor of sexual selection.,False,False,good,,,,,,
77,Another driver is competition between males.,False,False,good,,,,,,
78,"When the bros have to fight each other to gain access to females, adaptations that help them when a fight are selected for.",False,False,good,,,,,,
79,"Often this results in the evolution of weaponry, like long canines or tusks, even in animals that only eat leaves or vegetables.",False,False,good,,,,,,
80,The pervasus males have quite a bit of competing to do.,False,False,good,,,,,,
81,Their social system is organized into herons where one male has access to a number of females.,False,False,good,,,,,,
82,"I know what you're thinking, those noses don't look like weapons to me unless you count a good noodle slapping, but they still can be used in combat.",True,True,good,,,,,,
83,Sort of.,False,False,good,,,,,,
84,"These monkey herons often live close to one another, and females sometimes decide to move between them.",False,False,good,,,,,,
85,So there's plenty of opportunities for fights as males defend their turf.,False,False,good,,,,,,
86,But fighting is a real bummer.,False,False,good,,,,,,
87,"Sorry, but fighting is a real bummer.",False,False,good,,,,,,
88,They can get hurt.,False,False,good,,,,,,
89,And they haven't invented the band aid yet.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
90,"Why would they, with all that fur it'd be a right pitch to take off.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
91,"So if there's a way a monkey can predict that he's likely to lose a fight before it happens, that would certainly be useful in not getting dead.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
92,"Now if you can see the size of your challenger, you can just make good choices.",False,False,good,,,,,,
93,"But where they live, the visibility isn't that great.",False,False,good,,,,,,
94,What with all the leaves.,False,False,good,,,,,,
95,And that's where the noises come in.,False,False,good,,,,,,
96,Propossus monkeys make a lot of noise.,False,False,good,,,,,,
97,It can sound a bit like a donkey swallowed a dialop modem.,False,False,good,,,,,,
98,I think you know where this is headed.,False,False,good,,,,,,
99,"A larger nose helps make a louder, lower sound.",False,False,good,,,,,,
100,And we already know that large noses correlate to large bodies.,False,False,good,,,,,,
101,So a male can listen to another male's call and decide if he wants to rumble.,False,False,good,,,,,,
102,And the females they're listening in too.,False,False,good,,,,,,
103,Because a louder sound means bigger testicles.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
104,And telling you it's a whole thing.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
105,So the propossus nose might be a bit of a both-end.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
106,Starting to evolve as a signal for males and then driven to extremes by female choice.,False,False,good,,,,,,
107,These monkeys have something else that's both used to attract mates and to warn other males.,False,False,good,,,,,,
108,"Go ahead, Jerry.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
109,"Now humans have more of a right place, right time sort of erection.",False,False,good,,,,,,
110,"For the propossus monkey, the time is always in the places everywhere.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
111,They have a brightly colored and more or less permanent erection.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
112,It's not always turned up to 11.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
113,There's the sort of everyday walking about erection.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
114,This one's measuring his SPL.,False,False,good,,,,,,
115,And here's a more elegant cocktail party sort of erection.,True,True,good,,,,,,
116,But they reserve a more straight-up man-spreading erection as a warning for when they're about to get aggressive.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
117,We don't do that.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
118,It's a shame.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
119,We'd make MMA weigh-ins more exciting.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
120,"Well, Conor McGregor certainly showed up to fight.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
121,"But no, we can't even use ours to flag down a bus.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
122,Trust me I've tried it.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
123,Bus kept going.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
124,And I know what you're going to say.,False,False,good,,,,,,
125,I have read somewhere that the human male genitalia is proportionately larger than what the apes on the monkeys are carrying about.,False,False,good,,,,,,
126,That is like the most human thing to think.,False,False,good,,,,,,
127,It's like how everybody says their hometown has the best drinking water.,False,False,good,,,,,,
128,"It's bullshitt. The researcher Alan Dixon, son of Dix, so you know he's for real, he looked into it and found that humans are pretty unremarkable and average down there.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
129,But what about our big noses?,False,False,good,,,,,,
130,There must be something special there.,False,False,good,,,,,,
131,"Well, no surprise the science hippies can't even agree on it.",True,True,good,,,,,,
132,One idea was that when we moved to colder places bigger noses were better at warming and moistening the air.,False,False,good,,,,,,
133,That one's refuted.,False,False,good,,,,,,
134,Not just futed.,False,False,good,,,,,,
135,They futed it again.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
136,There's another idea that our big noses gave us stereo smell for navigation.,False,False,good,,,,,,
137,Not refuted yet.,False,False,good,,,,,,
138,And then there's the simple idea that it's just the byproduct of our bigger brains.,False,False,good,,,,,,
139,"As our skulls got bigger our faces flattened, leaving our nose out there like a little flesh island.",False,False,good,,,,,,
140,"So just remember, if you want to laugh at a monkey with a big nose and a funny-looking penis call up a friend and get naked.",True,True,good,,,,,,
141,It's a hell of a lot cheaper than going to Borneo.,False,False,good,,,,,,
142,"Alright, so you want a statue of the monkey, right?",True,True,good,,,,,,
143,How big?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
144,"Oh, that's big.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
145,You want a realistic life like?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
146,"Oh, okay.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
147,"Well, what about the erect?",True,True,good,,,,,,
148,Right.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
149,"No, I understand the tourists.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
150,How about this?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
151,We put grapes in front of it.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
152,"Yeah, no, that's no problem.",True,True,good,,,,,,
153,Anything else?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
154,"Oh, it's a fountain?",True,True,good,,,,,,
155,"Oh, that's new.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
156,Alright.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
157,"Well, in Italy a lot of times the water comes out from the tip of the... We're hear me out.",True,True,good,,,,,,
158,It would come up from behind the grapes in this really beautiful arc.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
159,No?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
160,"Oh, I've got it.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
161,We'll make it look like it's vomiting.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
162,Projectile vomiting.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
163,All over everything.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
0,Hello and welcome to another coding challenge.,False,False,good,,,,,,
1,"Well, I'm excited about this one.",True,True,good,,,,,,
2,"In this coding challenge, I'm going to attempt to make this fern.",True,True,good,,,,,,
3,"The barnsley fern, named for the British mathematician Michael Barnsley.",False,False,good,,,,,,
4,"I encourage you to read this Wikipedia page, which will give you more background on it.",False,False,good,,,,,,
5,What I'm going to do is just look at the algorithm and try to write that algorithm into code and see if we can get that result.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
6,"And then you, the creative viewer of this coding challenge, will make your own version with different colors.",False,False,good,,,,,,
7,And you'll think about animating it and do all sorts of things that I couldn't possibly even imagine.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
8,"So, for what is the algorithm here?",False,False,good,,,,,,
9,"So, if we look down here, I'm just going to skip down down here.",True,True,good,,,,,,
10,"It says, the first point is drawn at the origin x equals 0, y equals 0.",False,False,good,,,,,,
11,So what this means is where you need some sort of two-dimensional space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
12,"It could be a processing canvas and I want to start at 0, 0.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
13,"Now, I'm going to think of 0, 0 in the center here.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
14,"And I'm going to have to probably figure out some ways of, well, the pixels are here, but then 0, 0 on the pixel spaces here.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
15,But I'm not going to worry about that right now.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
16,"And then, what's the next step?",False,False,good,,,,,,
17,"The next step is, and then the new points are iteratively computed by randomly applying one of the four following coordinate transformations.",False,False,good,,,,,,
18,"And here they are to find out this is the kind of stuff that you might see and think: ""AHH! OK, I'm going to go do something else.""",True,True,good,,,,,,
19,This looks like matrix math and linear algebra.,False,False,good,,,,,,
20,"But this is actually, first of all, if you watch some of my matrix videos, this is going to strangely enough make sense to you.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
21,But let me actually show you that this math is actually quite simple.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
22,Let's use just this second one and let's rewrite this over on the board.,False,False,good,,,,,,
23,"So, f of 2x, y equals, so I'm going to have to go back and check it, haha.",True,True,good,,,,,,
24,"0.85, 0.04, 0.85, 0.04.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
25,"Negative 0.04, negative 0.04, I should have made up my own numbers, haha.",True,True,good,,,,,,
26,"0.85, 0.85.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
27,"Then we have x, y. Oh no, I'm running out of space.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
28,I'm running out of space.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
29,"Plus, I can put this in.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
30,You can see that 0 and 1.6.,False,False,good,,,,,,
31,What does this mean?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
32,"Well, this is actually the matrix product or the matrix multiplication or the dot product.",False,False,good,,,,,,
33,What it means is I want to find the values.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
34,"If this is x1, y1, what I want to get is the next values for x.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
35,"So, I have one point and I want to know where does that point go?",True,False,bad,,,,,,
36,"What's x2, y2?",True,False,bad,,,,,,
37,"So, this being x2 equals this number times that 0.85, sorry, times x1 plus this number times that the row gets multiplied by the column, 0.04 times y1.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
38,And then plus this number plus 0.,False,False,good,,,,,,
39,"And then y2 then equals negative 0.04 times x1 plus 0.85, and my handwriting's terrible, times y1, this column times this column plus 1.6.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
40,"So, it's really just this formula.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
41,"If I have an xy coordinate, I get the next xy coordinate with this math.",False,False,good,,,,,,
42,And we can just double check that this is right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
43,Look at that for a second with my horrible messy handwriting.,True,True,good,,,,,,
44,"And then let's go down here and see, look at this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
45,It's the same thing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
46,"x, the next x is this number times the previous x plus this number times the previous y.",False,False,good,,,,,,
47,And the next y is this number times the previous x plus this number times the previous y plus 1.6.,False,False,good,,,,,,
48,"So, we just need to do one of these four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
49,And each one of those four we do according to a particular probability.,False,False,good,,,,,,
50,Right?,False,True,bad,,,,,,
51,"Oh right, ABCDE.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
52,"Yep, that could have written it this way.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
53,That's the generic way of writing.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
54,"Okay, so, all right, so let's go back into that, let's start writing some code.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
55,"All right, so I have a processing sketch, a Java-based programming environment with a nice API for drawing stuff and lots more processing.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
56,I'm going to say background equals zero.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
57,I'm going to have an x ââand a y. I'm going to set those to be zero to start.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
58,"I'm going to draw, I'm going to say stroke.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
59,255,False,False,good,,,,,,
60,Stroke weight.,False,False,good,,,,,,
61,"Sorry, stroke, stroke weight eight.",True,True,good,,,,,,
62,And then I'm going to draw a point at x point y.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
63,OK?,False,True,bad,,,,,,
64,And then what I need to do is get the next value.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
65,"So, next x equals some number, a times x plus b times y plus c. And actually, so let's just use these numbers here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
66,Let's just copy these.,False,False,good,,,,,,
67,0.85.04.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
68,0.85,False,False,good,,,,,,
69,Negative 0.04.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
70,Negative 0.04.0.85.,True,True,good,,,,,,
71,And next y is negative 0.04.0.05.,False,False,good,,,,,,
72,0.05,False,False,good,,,,,,
73,0.05.0.25.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
74,0.05.0.25.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
75,0.05.0.25.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
76,0.05.0.25.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
77,"No, what's going on?",True,True,good,,,,,,
78,"OK, everything's fine now.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
79,"Breathe, everybody.",False,False,good,,,,,,
80,Breathe would be.,False,False,good,,,,,,
81,"Okay, so this is applying that particular transformation.",False,False,good,,,,,,
82,And then I could just say x equals next x. Y equals next y.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
83,"So, what if I were to do this and run this?",True,False,bad,,,,,,
84,I don't get any errors.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
85,"So, I do see this circle over here being drawn.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
86,"So, here's the thing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
87,I'm only applying one of those transformations.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
88,I need to pick one of four.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
89,And I also am not thinking sort of thoughtfully about the pixel space.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
90,"So, I need to do a mapping, right?",True,True,good,,,,,,
91,"x with pixels goes from 0 to 600, 0 to 600.",False,False,good,,,,,,
92,But maybe I want to think of this as a space between negative 1 and 1 and negative 1 and 1.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
93,"So, what I want to do is say, when I actually go to draw it, pixel x equals map x, which goes between negative 1 and 1 to 0 and width, and pixel y between negative 1 and 1.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
94,"And I'm going to flip the axis, height, 0.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
95,"And then I'm going to draw the point at px, py.",True,True,good,,,,,,
96,Let's run this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
97,"And then, oh, okay, and then I only want to draw the background once.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
98,"And we can see, there we go.",False,False,good,,,,,,
99,"So, if I apply that transformation over and over again, we can see the point going up that way.",False,False,good,,,,,,
100,"Now, is that right?",True,True,good,,,,,,
101,That looked weird to me.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
102,This has to be y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
103,"Yes, this needs to be y. I was like mapping the x value.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
104,"I was like, why is it, uh, alright.",True,True,good,,,,,,
105,"So, uh, mmm, alright.",True,True,good,,,,,,
106,"It's not moving very much, but that's fine.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
107,I'm just applying this one transformation.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
108,"Alright, let's look at the values.",False,False,good,,,,,,
109,Just to sort of see what those values ââare doing.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
110,"And we can see, there we go.",False,False,good,,,,,,
111,"Now, it kind of settled.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
112,"Interestingly enough, it settled to a fixed point.",False,False,good,,,,,,
113,hmm,False,False,good,,,,,,
114,But here's the thing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
115,We need to do one of four transformations.,False,False,good,,,,,,
116,"So, I need to do the tedious thing.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
117,"Now, I could probably write the encode these into arrays and, like, automatically.",False,False,good,,,,,,
118,But I'm going to do this in a very long-winded way.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
119,Just to see the code.,False,False,good,,,,,,
120,I'm going to have four of these possibilities.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
121,"So, this is actually number two.",False,False,good,,,,,,
122,I need to have one.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
123,I need to have three.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
124,And I need to have four.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
125,And I probably should put these in a function.,True,True,good,,,,,,
126,"But, oh, there's so many ways I could organize the code to be better.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
127,But I'm going to just do it this way right now.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
128,"And I'm going to, maybe I'll refactor it all later, let you do that.",True,True,good,,,,,,
129,"So, let's go back and look at the algorithm.",False,False,good,,,,,,
130,This is just zero and point one six times y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
131,"So, this one is actually just zero.",False,False,good,,,,,,
132,"And this is actually just zero point one, zero point one six times y.",False,False,good,,,,,,
133,That's option number one.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
134,"Option number two, we did.",False,False,good,,,,,,
135,Option number three.,False,False,good,,,,,,
136,"Option number three is point two, negative point two six, point two, negative zero point two six.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
137,"And then point two three, point two two, one point six.",False,False,good,,,,,,
138,"Point two three, point two two, two point six, what that what it was?",True,False,bad,,,,,,
139,One point six.,False,False,good,,,,,,
140,"And then, option number four is negative point one five, point two eight.",False,False,good,,,,,,
141,You're really watching me do this.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
142,Negative one five and two eight.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
143,That's not right.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
144,"Yeah, it's right.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
145,"And then, two six two four four four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
146,Two six two four four four four.,False,False,good,,,,,,
147,Let's auto format all this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
148,"Okay, now, this is the really important part.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
149,I need everything to line up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
150,It's not lining up the way I wanted to.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
151,Help me line up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
152,"No, no, this plus has to go here.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
153,This has to go there.,False,False,good,,,,,,
154,That's ok now.,False,False,good,,,,,,
155,This is ok.,False,False,good,,,,,,
156,That's fine.,False,False,good,,,,,,
157,That's fine.,False,False,good,,,,,,
158,"OK, it's fine now.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
159,Everything's okay everybody.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
160,"Oh wait, no, no, no.",True,True,good,,,,,,
161,I need a zero here.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
162,Definitely need a zero there.,True,True,good,,,,,,
163,OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
164,What's wrong?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
165,"Oh, no, no.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
166,These have to go over because there's no negative there.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
167,"Oh, and this has, yeah, I don't like this.",True,True,good,,,,,,
168,This has to go over too.,False,False,good,,,,,,
169,"Yes, yes.",False,False,good,,,,,,
170,"OK, this has to go over.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
171,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
172,"OK, that's much better now.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
173,"Now, the other thing is, I'm just going to say float next x.",True,True,good,,,,,,
174,Float next y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
175,"And then, I'm going to, because I just wanted to clear the variables once.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
176,I'm going to get rid of all of these.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
177,"Yes, you're watching me do this in the most tedious, ridiculous way possible.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
178,"But it's good, this is good for you.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
179,"Because you're in your frustration and like, oh, I got a lot.",True,True,good,,,,,,
180,"You're going to, you're going to improve your coding skills by doing it in a different way.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
181,"Watching me and my poor, poor, poor way of doing this.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
182,OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
183,So this is good.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
184,"Now, I need to, now I'm going to pick a random number.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
185,"And I'm just going to say, I'm going to just do this.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
186,"If r is less, I'm going to, I'm going to do a one out of four chance for each of these.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
187,"If r is less than 0.25, do this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
188,"Otherwise, if r is less than 0.5, do this one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
189,"Otherwise, otherwise, if r is less than 0.75, do this one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
190,"And then otherwise, do the last one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
191,"So now, I'm just doing a one out of four chance of doing any of these.",True,True,good,,,,,,
192,OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
193,"So let's, all right.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
194,So let's run this and see what happens.,False,False,good,,,,,,
195,We're not going to get the fern.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
196,"But we should get, ooh, look at this.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
197,I'm getting something.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
198,"It's just, look at this.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
199,"Oh, it might even be like two.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
200,"It's just, look at this.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
201,"Oh, it might even be like, tree like.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
202,"So one thing I want to do is, I want to pick the, I want to take this, which is like, sort of like next point.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
203,"And I'm going to put that into its own function, next point.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
204,"So that I can, because I'm, I'm probably going to want to also do this.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
205,"Oh, and then I'm going to take this and draw a point.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
206,"And then, because I might want to do these multiple times in draw.",True,True,good,,,,,,
207,"So I think just, and I could probably do this in an object oriented way.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
208,I should probably store it in a ray of all the points.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
209,But let's just look at this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
210,"So now, let's, let me let this go a little faster.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
211,"Let me say, do a hundred of these transformations per frame.",False,False,good,,,,,,
212,"And we can see, and by the way, 0, 0 should be at the bottom.",False,False,good,,,,,,
213,I am now sort of figuring out.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
214,"So I'm going to put 0, 0 at the bottom.",True,True,good,,,,,,
215,"So I'm going to map this from a two, two down to 0.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
216,Right?,False,True,bad,,,,,,
217,"Oh whoa, I did that.",True,True,good,,,,,,
218,"No, 0 to 2, I mean.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
219,0 to 2,False,False,good,,,,,,
220,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
221,So here's my weird tree thing that I'm making without being thoughtful about those probabilities.,True,True,good,,,,,,
222,Let's go look at the Wikipedia page for those probabilities.,False,False,good,,,,,,
223,And you can see they're actually right here in this table.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
224,So this table is actually defining all those coefficients.,False,False,good,,,,,,
225,And here in repeat probability.,False,False,good,,,,,,
226,"So we have a 1% chance of the first one, 85% chance of the second, 7% chance of the third, and 7% chance of the fourth.",False,False,good,,,,,,
227,"So I'm actually going to put this, I'm going to amazingly do this in an array.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
228,"Well, actually, so, so, okay.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
229,"So there is, let's think about this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
230,Back here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
231,There's a 1% chance of this first one.,False,False,good,,,,,,
232,So I know that should be this.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
233,"Now, I want to have an 85% chance of this second one.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
234,"So now I actually need to look and see, is it less than 0.86?",True,True,good,,,,,,
235,"Because if it's less than 0.01, that's a 1% chance.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
236,And between 0.01 and 0.86 is 85%.,False,False,good,,,,,,
237,"Then I need to do less than 0.93, right?",True,True,good,,,,,,
238,Because there's a 7% chance of this third one.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
239,"And in all other cases, the fourth one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
240,So let's look at this now.,False,False,good,,,,,,
241,And are we going to get a barnsley firm?,False,True,bad,,,,,,
242,This is looking pretty good.,False,False,good,,,,,,
243,"Now, everything's like way off the screen, right?",True,True,good,,,,,,
244,Because I wasn't proud.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
245,"I was like, oh, that'll just make up between negative 1 and 1.",True,True,good,,,,,,
246,"But you might have noticed, remember the jazz timing?",True,False,bad,,,,,,
247,Plus 1.6.,False,False,good,,,,,,
248,"So clearly, the point can go further than that.",False,False,good,,,,,,
249,So let's give ourselves some more space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
250,So where are the mappings?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
251,The mappings are here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
252,Let's go from 0 to 4.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
253,And let's try negative 2 to 2.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
254,And let's make the stroke weight a little bit less.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
255,Let's give ourselves much more space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
256,"Oh, look at that.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
257,Beauty-us-ness.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
258,Barnsley firm.,False,False,good,,,,,,
259,That looks about right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
260,OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
261,So I'm done.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
262,Even though I want to do so much more.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
263,But I'm not going to.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
264,I'm going to let you do more.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
265,"Because what can you, how could you animate this?",True,False,bad,,,,,,
266,How could you pick color?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
267,How could you consider the space?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
268,How could you connect the points?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
269,How could you render this in a different way?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
270,There's so many possibilities.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
271,But I'm going to leave this at this.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
272,I've just done the core algorithm.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
273,And we have this barnsley firm.,False,False,good,,,,,,
274,"And you know, you can, by the way, you can draw.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
275,You can see here's variations of this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
276,"Why is mine kind of different than this, though?",True,False,bad,,,,,,
277,"So first of all, I'm discovering here.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
278,This is actually giving me the correct range.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
279,So let's actually do this range.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
280,Let's go into the code and implement the range that was on the Wikipedia page.,False,False,good,,,,,,
281,So negative.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
282,To there.,False,False,good,,,,,,
283,"And then zero to, let's try this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
284,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
285,OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
286,So I wasn't mapping the proper range.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
287,So it didn't curve to the right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
288,But now I am mapping the full barnsley firm.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
289,Thank you very much.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
290,I really want to make it rainbow color and do other stuff.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
291,But we have completed it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
292,This is the barnsley firm fractal in processing in about three hours and 42 minutes.,False,False,good,,,,,,
293,Thanks for watching this entire video.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
294,And I hope you make a variation of this in some way that I couldn't possibly imagine.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
295,And share it with me.,False,False,good,,,,,,
296,Share it in the comments.,False,False,good,,,,,,
297,There's a way you can go to the coding train.com and submit a link to your contribution.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
298,"And on Twitter, at shift minarets, the coding train.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
299,OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
300,thanks,False,True,bad,,,,,,
301,And I will see you all in the next coding challenge.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
0," Okay, hello and welcome to a coding challenge.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
1,Google Chrome dinosaur game edition.,False,False,good,,,,,,
2,"Unfortunately, I don't have my train whistle.",False,False,good,,,,,,
3,I didn't bring it with me today.,False,False,good,,,,,,
4,So this is definitely not going to go well.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
5,"Not that any of my coding challenges ever go well, but I'm going to give this a try.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
6,I'm going to attempt to program quickly.,False,False,good,,,,,,
7,The Google Chrome dinosaur game.,False,False,good,,,,,,
8,I'm going to use my own images and stuff.,False,False,good,,,,,,
9,"So it will be the unicorn game, of course.",False,False,good,,,,,,
10,"I'm going to use P5Jess, the JavaScript library P5Jess, and I'm going to interact with it in a unique way that you have to stick around for the end of the video.",False,False,good,,,,,,
11,I'll just tell you now.,False,False,good,,,,,,
12,I'm going to try to control with my voice.,False,False,good,,,,,,
13,"Okay, so you skip to the end.",False,False,good,,,,,,
14,Maybe I'll be doing it there.,False,False,good,,,,,,
15,"Okay, so here we go.",False,False,good,,,,,,
16,Let's get started.,False,False,good,,,,,,
17,So what do I need to do?,False,False,good,,,,,,
18,"So first I'm going to make a, I'm going to add, I'm going to the P5 web editor.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
19,I'm going to add a file.,False,False,good,,,,,,
20,I'm going to call it a dyno.js.,False,False,good,,,,,,
21,"Even though it's not, let's call it unicorn.",False,False,good,,,,,,
22,Unicorn.js.,False,False,good,,,,,,
23,And that's going to be my unicorn.,False,False,good,,,,,,
24,And what do I need?,False,False,good,,,,,,
25,"I also need to have, those are like cactus thingies.",True,True,good,,,,,,
26,"I mean, those are going to be trains.",False,False,good,,,,,,
27,"So I'm going to make a train.js, add file.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
28,So let's start by creating the unicorn class unicorn.,False,False,good,,,,,,
29,"So I'm going to use object-oriented programming because, you know, I do, basically, this by the way is exactly the same as Slapy Bird.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
30,"So I'm really just doing the same thing over again, but, whatever.",True,True,good,,,,,,
31,This is a nice beginner-friendly challenge.,False,False,good,,,,,,
32,"So, and maybe using object-oriented programming is a little bit overkill.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
33,"But let's give the unicorn a x location at 50 and a y location, which will be height, because it's sitting at the bottom of the window, but maybe I'll say like height minus 50 right now.",False,False,good,,,,,,
34,"And then I'm going to create a function called show, and I'm going to draw it.",False,False,good,,,,,,
35,"I'm just going to draw as a rectangle right now at this.x, this.y, and I'll make it 50, 50.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
36,So this is the unicorn class.,False,False,good,,,,,,
37,"A unicorn object has an x and a y, and when I draw it, it's a rectangle at that x and a y with a width and height of 50.",False,False,good,,,,,,
38,And those will probably need to be variables eventually.,False,False,good,,,,,,
39,So let me make a variable called unicorn.,False,False,good,,,,,,
40,"I'm going to say unicorn is a new unicorn, and I'm going to say here unicorn.show.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
41,And let's run this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
42,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
43,"Oh, OK.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
44,"So of course I forgot what I always forget, which is that I've added some new JavaScript files, and I need to reference them in my HTML.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
45,Unicorn and what was the other thing called train?,False,False,good,,,,,,
46,All right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
47,So that's a unicorn.,False,False,good,,,,,,
48,"And what I want is, but let me play that game again.",False,False,good,,,,,,
49,How does it work?,False,False,good,,,,,,
50,It just sits there.,False,False,good,,,,,,
51,"So every time I press the space bar, it jumps.",False,False,good,,,,,,
52,So let's get it to do that first.,False,False,good,,,,,,
53,Let's get it to do that first.,False,False,good,,,,,,
54,So what does it need in order to be able to jump?,False,False,good,,,,,,
55,"It needs a velocity, a speed along the y axis.",False,False,good,,,,,,
56,"So let's call this vy, and we'll say that's zero.",False,False,good,,,,,,
57,"And we'll write a function called jump, which we will give it kind of this like instant force.",False,False,good,,,,,,
58,So we're going to like push it up.,False,False,good,,,,,,
59,"So I'm going to say this dot vy equals, let's say like negative five.",False,False,good,,,,,,
60,That's moving it up.,False,False,good,,,,,,
61,"And then I'm going to write a function called move, which says this dot y plus equals this dot vy.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
62,"So what we should see now is if I say unicorn dot move, and then if I add function key pressed and say if the key is the space bar, unicorn dot jump.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
63,This really is basically the same as flappy birds so far.,False,False,good,,,,,,
64,Then we should see that velocity kick in.,False,False,good,,,,,,
65,So I'm always moving it based on whatever that velocity is.,False,False,good,,,,,,
66,"But the velocity is zero, the speed is zero.",False,False,good,,,,,,
67,"But as soon as I say jump, it sets the speed to negative five, and we should start to see it move up.",False,False,good,,,,,,
68,Here we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
69,And I'm moving along here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
70,I'm going to press space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
71,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
72,"Ah, goodbye unicorn.",True,True,good,,,,,,
73,See you later.,True,True,good,,,,,,
74,All right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
75,So we need gravity.,False,False,good,,,,,,
76,"So we need some form of gravity, which probably makes sense as a global variable, but I'm just going to, since the gravity is really only going to affect the unicorn.",False,False,good,,,,,,
77,I'm going to put it in here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
78,Let's say it's a zero point five.,False,False,good,,,,,,
79,So gravity is in a way a counteracting force.,False,False,good,,,,,,
80,"So no matter what it's doing, the gravity is always adjusting the speed of the unicorn, the acceleration basically.",False,False,good,,,,,,
81,So what I can do now also in move is say this dot VY plus equal this dot gravity.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
82,"However, I don't want to ever let, because now it's gone.",False,False,good,,,,,,
83,I don't want to ever let the unicorn fall off the bottom.,False,False,good,,,,,,
84,It should be basically a ground level.,False,False,good,,,,,,
85,So I'm going to do that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
86,So let's make this 50 a size.,False,False,good,,,,,,
87,Let's say R equals 50.,False,False,good,,,,,,
88,So we're going to kind of use that for all the parts where we're drawing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
89,"And then I'm also going to say, I'm going to have a constraint.",False,False,good,,,,,,
90,So I'm going to say this dot Y equals constraint.,False,False,good,,,,,,
91,"It's current Y value between zero and really where it's sitting at the bottom, which is also height minus this dot R. So it's stuck there.",False,False,good,,,,,,
92,"And now if I press, oops, press space, you can see it jumps.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
93,Now that's a very measly little jump.,True,True,good,,,,,,
94,We need to be able to jump much more.,False,False,good,,,,,,
95,So let's set this to like 25.,False,False,good,,,,,,
96,And let's see what happens.,False,False,good,,,,,,
97,Okay.,False,False,good,,,,,,
98,That's too much.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
99,Let's just set it to 10.,False,False,good,,,,,,
100,Maybe I need to make the gravity stronger too.,False,False,good,,,,,,
101,So there's going to be a lot of fine tuning of this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
102,But let's just do that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
103,And let me set this to 25.,False,False,good,,,,,,
104,Whoops.,True,True,good,,,,,,
105,And maybe let's set the gravity to two.,False,False,good,,,,,,
106,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
107,This feels a bit more like the dinosaur game.,False,False,good,,,,,,
108,So this is kind of sad.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
109,Let's make our unicorn look a little bit more exciting.,False,False,good,,,,,,
110,Let's load an image.,False,False,good,,,,,,
111,"So I have on the desktop here, I have some images.",False,False,good,,,,,,
112,"I have a background, which will be the background of the game.",False,False,good,,,,,,
113,I have a unicorn.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
114,"This will be the character with a little angry, equal sign sitting on it.",False,False,good,,,,,,
115,And then the train will be the thing and has to jump over.,False,False,good,,,,,,
116,"So let's, so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to add these files.",False,False,good,,,,,,
117,I'm going to add file.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
118,And I'm going to drag them in to the web editor.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
119,It uploaded all of them.,False,False,good,,,,,,
120,"And then in here, I'm going to add preload.",False,False,good,,,,,,
121,"And I'm going to have let you image, let t image, and let background image.",False,False,good,,,,,,
122,And let's load all those.,False,False,good,,,,,,
123,U image equals load image unicorn.png.,False,False,good,,,,,,
124,And we're doing the same.,False,False,good,,,,,,
125,"For t image and background image, this is train.",False,False,good,,,,,,
126,And this is background.,False,False,good,,,,,,
127,"Let's change the background to, ooh.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
128,So what did I get wrong here?,False,False,good,,,,,,
129,Background is actually a JPEG.,False,False,good,,,,,,
130,So let's have the background now be background image.,False,False,good,,,,,,
131,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
132,And let's have the unicorn.,False,False,good,,,,,,
133,Where is it be?,False,False,good,,,,,,
134,"I'm going to say image, unicorn image.",False,False,good,,,,,,
135,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
136,It's so tiny.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
137,"Oh, it's not pixelated.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
138,It's so sad.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
139,Let's change this to 150.,False,False,good,,,,,,
140,"That's, but it's x value shouldn't be here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
141,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
142,So there's our jumping unicorn.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
143,This is not a lot of screen real estate to work with.,False,False,good,,,,,,
144,"So let me actually load a background image that's 800 pixels wide, which I think will be a little better than 600.",False,False,good,,,,,,
145,"All right, my unicorn can jump.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
146,"And I've made the background a little wider, which means now I need obstacles for it to jump over.",False,False,good,,,,,,
147,And those are going to be little train things.,False,False,good,,,,,,
148,"So I'm going to make another class, call it a train.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
149,Choo-choo.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
150,I'm going to give that a constructor.,False,False,good,,,,,,
151,These will have also an x and a y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
152,"So the x will be, it's going to start off the edge.",False,False,good,,,,,,
153,"And the y will be, actually also at the bottom.",False,False,good,,,,,,
154,"So height minus, I'll give it a size.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
155,And this dot r will be 100.,False,False,good,,,,,,
156,"And then, so now I need a show function.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
157,"And that I'm going to draw as an image, like fingers are in the wrong place, the train image at x and y.",False,False,good,,,,,,
158,"This dot r, this dot r. And let's also add a move function.",False,False,good,,,,,,
159,And we'll say this dot x minus equals.,False,False,good,,,,,,
160,"And so the train, so this is a weird thing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
161,"It's supposed to be, oh, this is going to be a problem.",False,False,good,,,,,,
162,My fixed background is going to make this visually a problem.,False,False,good,,,,,,
163,And people on the chat are saying parallax background please.,False,False,good,,,,,,
164,"All right, so maybe I'm going to get to that.",False,False,good,,,,,,
165,This is going to end up being a longer video if I implement that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
166,"But really, the unicorn is moving.",False,False,good,,,,,,
167,"So the unicorn is moving, but the x stays fixed.",False,False,good,,,,,,
168,"The trains, well, the trains could be moving if they're trains.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
169,That's weird.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
170,"But they're supposed to be cactuses, cacti.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
171,They're standing still and the unicorn is just approaching them.,False,False,good,,,,,,
172,But we're seeing it from the unicorns point of view.,False,False,good,,,,,,
173,"Oh, I've really botched this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
174,But what I'm going to do is just move them by the whole scene is scrolling by three pixels.,False,False,good,,,,,,
175,"And we'll figure out if we can parallax the background, maybe later.",False,False,good,,,,,,
176,"What do I even mean by parallax to make it appear as if the background is changing, but often the distance, so it's sort of moving at a different speed.",False,False,good,,,,,,
177,"But for now, let's just do this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
178,Let's create an array called trains.,False,False,good,,,,,,
179,"And we're going to say, train in setup.",False,False,good,,,,,,
180,"Well, actually, you know what we're going to do in draw?",False,False,good,,,,,,
181,We're just going to randomly.,False,False,good,,,,,,
182,We're going to pick a random number between 0 and 1.,False,False,good,,,,,,
183,"And we'll say 1% of the time, we're going to say trains.push.",False,False,good,,,,,,
184,We're going to add a new train.,False,False,good,,,,,,
185,So it's going to be irregular.,False,False,good,,,,,,
186,"This is different than the flappy bird I made where the, I think the pipes, maybe it was a regular.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
187,I thought the pipes were regular intervals.,False,False,good,,,,,,
188,Now there's a random chance of adding a new train.,False,False,good,,,,,,
189,"And then all of the trains that exist, we're going to say four, all of the train, the dodged, say T in trains.",False,False,good,,,,,,
190,"I'm going to say T dot move, T dot show.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
191,"All right, let's see what happens.",False,False,good,,,,,,
192,Do we have a train?,False,True,bad,,,,,,
193,Maybe I better increase this.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
194,"Oh, there we go.",False,False,good,,,,,,
195,"Oh, look at that.",False,False,good,,,,,,
196,"All right, they're moving.",False,False,good,,,,,,
197,They're kind of slow.,False,False,good,,,,,,
198,I'm going to jump over it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
199,"OK, let's make them move a little faster.",False,False,good,,,,,,
200,So we've got some tweaking we've got to do.,False,False,good,,,,,,
201,"Whoa, this is a nice way.",True,True,good,,,,,,
202,"Now, look, my unicorn can fly.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
203,"So I need to fix the fact, I need to not allow my unicorn to fly, right?",True,False,bad,,,,,,
204,I should only be able to jump if I'm at the bottom.,False,False,good,,,,,,
205,So let's fix that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
206,"So to do that, I need to go into unicorn.",False,False,good,,,,,,
207,"And in the jump function, I should only be allowed to jump if I'm sitting at the bottom.",False,False,good,,,,,,
208,"So in other words, if y is, oh, well, if I'm at the bottom.",False,False,good,,,,,,
209,"So as long as y is equal to, is this really going to work?",False,False,good,,,,,,
210,I don't like to use equal checks.,False,False,good,,,,,,
211,"But this is, by definition, sitting at the bottom.",False,False,good,,,,,,
212,"So only if I'm sitting at the bottom, can I jump?",False,False,good,,,,,,
213,"So if y is equal to that spot, let's see if that works.",False,False,good,,,,,,
214,"So jump, oops, jump.",True,True,good,,,,,,
215,"Oh, this dot y.",False,False,good,,,,,,
216,"Come on, trains.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
217,"Oh yeah, yep, I can only jump when I'm at the bottom.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
218,"All right, so that works.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
219,So that fixed.,False,False,good,,,,,,
220,I think I need to be able to jump quite a bit higher.,False,False,good,,,,,,
221,Let's try 35.,False,False,good,,,,,,
222,Should really use like a slider or something.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
223,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
224,I think this is going to make the game more possible to win.,False,False,good,,,,,,
225,There's too many trains.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
226,Too many trains.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
227,One thing that's bothering me is the trains are going in front of the unicorn.,False,False,good,,,,,,
228,I know that doesn't really matter.,False,False,good,,,,,,
229,So much.,False,False,good,,,,,,
230,It's really doesn't matter.,False,False,good,,,,,,
231,But I kind of would prefer them to be behind.,False,False,good,,,,,,
232,So I'm going to move this here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
233,I'm also going to make the game a little easier to play.,False,False,good,,,,,,
234,I'm going to reduce the number of trains.,False,False,good,,,,,,
235,So there's going to be a much lower probability of there being a train.,False,False,good,,,,,,
236,"Let's see if I can actually play this game somewhat successfully, even though I'm not doing the collision checking yet.",False,False,good,,,,,,
237,No.,False,False,good,,,,,,
238,"I think if the trains move faster, it would actually make it easier.",False,False,good,,,,,,
239,So let's actually double the speed of the trains.,False,False,good,,,,,,
240,All right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
241,This looks like this game is now possible to play.,False,False,good,,,,,,
242,But I need to add collision detection.,False,False,good,,,,,,
243,So I've done this before in plenty of other coding challenges.,False,False,good,,,,,,
244,There's a pretty simple algorithm to just check if two rectangles are intersecting with each other or not.,False,False,good,,,,,,
245,I can just check their x's and y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
246,"They're basically all of the edges, the left, the right, the top, the bottom against each other.",False,False,good,,,,,,
247,But this is a nice opportunity for me to just explore a library that's out there in the world.,False,False,good,,,,,,
248,And this library is called P5 Collide 2D.,False,False,good,,,,,,
249,And it actually has a function that it called Collide Rectangle Rectangle.,False,False,good,,,,,,
250,"And it'll give me a Boolean variable if I give it the x, y with height of one rectangle and the x, y with height of another rectangle.",False,False,good,,,,,,
251,So let's actually just use this library.,False,False,good,,,,,,
252,This is also a nice excuse for me to show you that GitHub is now integrated with something called JSDeliver.,False,False,good,,,,,,
253,"So this is an open source content delivery network, meaning if a JavaScript file is hosted on GitHub, I don't have to download that file and then add it to my project.",False,False,good,,,,,,
254,I can just link to it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
255,So I'm going to go over here to GitHub.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
256,There's lots of different ways here that I can reference a file on GitHub.,False,False,good,,,,,,
257,I think the easiest way for what I'm doing right now is just to reference its path.,False,False,good,,,,,,
258,And here's an example path.,False,False,good,,,,,,
259,So I'm going to go over here to index.html.,False,False,good,,,,,,
260,I'm going to add another script tag.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
261,"I'm going to say script, source equals.",False,False,good,,,,,,
262,"I'm going to paste that in, closed script.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
263,But this is not the path that I want.,False,False,good,,,,,,
264,"I want the username, which is B-M-O-R-E-N. And then I want the path to let's get the minified version of the library.",False,False,good,,,,,,
265,"And that would just be this, right there in the root directory.",False,False,good,,,,,,
266,So now I'm just referencing that file.,False,False,good,,,,,,
267,Let's see if that works.,False,False,good,,,,,,
268,This is actually not correct.,False,False,good,,,,,,
269,"I'm referencing the CDN URL, the username, but I also need the repo name.",False,False,good,,,,,,
270,So that should be p5.collide2d slash this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
271,So this should now work.,False,False,good,,,,,,
272,And I should be able to use the collide function.,False,False,good,,,,,,
273,So I'm going to use this collide rectangle rectangle.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
274,Let me just call this in draw to see if that works.,False,False,good,,,,,,
275,And it doesn't give me an error.,False,False,good,,,,,,
276,Great.,True,True,good,,,,,,
277,No error.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
278,"And so now I can check when I'm going through all of the trains if unicorn hits t, console log game over.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
279,So console log game over.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
280,And then I'm actually going to say no loop.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
281,"So I'm just going to actually stop the sketch, shut down the sketch completely, which isn't a really thoughtful user experience design choice.",False,False,good,,,,,,
282,But it's what I'm going to do for right now.,False,False,good,,,,,,
283,And then I just need to add a function here called hits and receives a train.,False,False,good,,,,,,
284,"And I can use this function, which I need this.x, this.y, this.r, this.r.",False,False,good,,,,,,
285,And then I need exactly the same thing but with that particular train.,False,False,good,,,,,,
286,"So instead of this, I'm checking this rectangle with this trains rectangle.",False,False,good,,,,,,
287,And I'm going to put this in a variable called collide.,False,False,good,,,,,,
288,And I'm going to say if I am going to return that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
289,"I can actually, you know what?",False,True,bad,,,,,,
290,I'm just returning this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
291,Return that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
292,So return the true or false result of this collide function from that library.,False,False,good,,,,,,
293,And now let's run the game.,False,False,good,,,,,,
294,I'll wait for our first train.,False,False,good,,,,,,
295,Game over.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
296,Let's see if I can play it now.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
297,"Oh, there are so many trains, oh well, you're hooked.",True,True,good,,,,,,
298,Let's make the train a little bit smaller.,False,False,good,,,,,,
299,"And actually, let's make the unicorn smaller as well.",False,False,good,,,,,,
300,Hopefully this will help.,False,False,good,,,,,,
301,"All right, let's draw the box.",False,False,good,,,,,,
302,Let's debug this a little bit by drawing the box like very subtly.,False,False,good,,,,,,
303,So let's draw a very slight rectangle.,False,False,good,,,,,,
304,This is what we're actually checking.,False,False,good,,,,,,
305,There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
306,It helps to see the full box.,False,False,good,,,,,,
307,"Come on, trains.",False,False,good,,,,,,
308,Spawning a train with a mouse click would be a good idea.,False,False,good,,,,,,
309,"OK, we lost.",False,False,good,,,,,,
310,"All right, so there's obviously a lot of gameplay improvements that need to happen here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
311,"One is I could be more thoughtful about, you can see how there's some wasted space here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
312,I should crop the image and the actual rectangle a little bit smaller.,False,False,good,,,,,,
313,I could consider using a circle.,False,False,good,,,,,,
314,I could use a more complex shape.,False,False,good,,,,,,
315,But this is good enough for right now.,False,False,good,,,,,,
316,Let's actually make it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
317,I could also just click the mouse in order to start a train that actually might help things.,False,False,good,,,,,,
318,But let me comment out this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
319,"And what I want to do just before I go, before I finish saying, you're going to make a version of this with a score and all sorts of nicer things and sounds.",False,False,good,,,,,,
320,But I've got to finish this off.,False,False,good,,,,,,
321,I've got to finish this video.,False,False,good,,,,,,
322,I want to control the train with my voice.,False,False,good,,,,,,
323,"So to do that, I'm going to use ML5JS, which has a speech commands machine learning model built into this JavaScript library.",False,False,good,,,,,,
324,So I made a whole separate video about this particular pre-trained model and how it works.,False,False,good,,,,,,
325,So I'm just going to add it pretty quickly into this video.,False,False,good,,,,,,
326,You can go watch the other one for more details.,False,False,good,,,,,,
327,"But if you're looking for the documentation, if I click on reference, and go to sound classifier, this is what I'm looking at doing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
328,"So all I need to, first thing I need to do is, well, actually, one thing I need to do is I need to go to get started.",False,False,good,,,,,,
329,And I need to get a script tag to be able to reference the library.,False,False,good,,,,,,
330,So I want to add the ML5 library.,False,False,good,,,,,,
331,So I'm copying this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
332,I'm going here to index the HTML.,False,False,good,,,,,,
333,"So in addition to P5Cly2D, I'm now adding ML5.",False,False,good,,,,,,
334,And I'm going to go here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
335,And I'm going to in preload.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
336,"I'm going to do let sound classifier, create a variable in preload.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
337,I'm going to say sound classifier equals ML5 sound classifier.,False,False,good,,,,,,
338,And the model I'm loading is called speech commands 18W.,False,False,good,,,,,,
339,Because this is a model that's been trained to recognize 18 particular words.,False,False,good,,,,,,
340,"Zero, the digits, zero through nine, up, down, left, right, and a few other ones that are documented on this ML5 webpage.",False,False,good,,,,,,
341,Let's go look that up real quick.,False,False,good,,,,,,
342,"So if I go back to sound classifier, up, down, left, right, go, stop, yes, no.",False,False,good,,,,,,
343,So those are the words it's trained to recognize.,False,False,good,,,,,,
344,And I actually also want to get this probability threshold.,False,False,good,,,,,,
345,"So I'm going to add this in here, because I want it to be really sure I'm saying jump.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
346,So I'm going to make this 95.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
347,This means it's got to be 95% sure.,False,False,good,,,,,,
348,The confidence score that's coming from that particular model.,False,False,good,,,,,,
349,"And how that model was trained, and there's all the paper you can read.",False,False,good,,,,,,
350,And I've talked about that more in the other video.,False,False,good,,,,,,
351,"So now that I have that, in setup, I can say sound classifier.classify, then I can get a function.",False,False,good,,,,,,
352,I'm going to call it got word.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
353,We're got command.,False,False,good,,,,,,
354,Let's call it got command.,False,False,good,,,,,,
355,So this is a callback function that is going to trigger any time it gets a command.,False,False,good,,,,,,
356,"It gets an error first, error first callbacks, and then the results.",False,False,good,,,,,,
357,"So I'm just going to say if there's an error, I'm just going to console error the error.",False,False,good,,,,,,
358,"Otherwise, if results index 0 dot label.",False,False,good,,,,,,
359,So results as an array with labels and confidence scores.,False,False,good,,,,,,
360,The labels are the words.,False,False,good,,,,,,
361,And what I'm looking for is the word up.,False,False,good,,,,,,
362,"If that label is up, then unicorn jump.",False,False,good,,,,,,
363,So this is a really quick way of me looking for a particular keyword from that library.,False,False,good,,,,,,
364,And I'm also just going to console log results index 0 dot label.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
365,Just to see if I'm getting other words also.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
366,And we might as well log the confidence score just so we can see that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
367,That might be good for debugging as well.,False,False,good,,,,,,
368,"So now that I've logged those two things, I'm going to run this sketch.",False,False,good,,,,,,
369,Shoot.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
370,But you can see it got up 95%.,False,False,good,,,,,,
371,I'm going to add the thing where I click the mouse and I can give myself a train.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
372,"And in fact, let's comment out the random trains.",False,False,good,,,,,,
373,"Also, I really should be more thoughtful about how I'm picking the train.",False,False,good,,,,,,
374,"Like when the train should come, like maybe there's a minimum distance between them.",False,False,good,,,,,,
375,"If I've just added one, can I have a longer train with other train cars?",False,True,bad,,,,,,
376,I don't know what's going on here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
377,There's a lot of narrative flaws in what's going on here.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
378,But I'm just going to add one myself.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
379,Up.,False,False,good,,,,,,
380,Yes.,False,False,good,,,,,,
381,Up.,False,False,good,,,,,,
382,Shoot.,False,False,good,,,,,,
383,All right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
384,Everyone is making the suggestion in the chat that I should change it to a circle.,False,False,good,,,,,,
385,So that'll actually kind of be like around it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
386,It'll give me a little wiggle room along the edges and make the intersection happen a little less often.,False,False,good,,,,,,
387,So let's actually go ahead and do that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
388,So I'm going to go into where the only place where I'm doing this collision detection is where in the unicorn under hits.,False,False,good,,,,,,
389,"So I'm going to change this to collide circle circle, collide circle circle, and circle to circle assumes ellipse mode center.",False,False,good,,,,,,
390,"So I'm going to have to think of the circle as the center point of the object, which is not a big deal.",False,False,good,,,,,,
391,"So the way that I'm going to do that, let's make some separate variables.",False,False,good,,,,,,
392,Let's say x1 equals this dot x plus this dot r times 0.5.,False,False,good,,,,,,
393,So this would be the middle.,False,False,good,,,,,,
394,This is the middle.,False,False,good,,,,,,
395,And then r is the diameter of the circle.,False,False,good,,,,,,
396,So that's fine.,False,False,good,,,,,,
397,This is y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
398,"And then x2, y2 is the train.",False,False,good,,,,,,
399,"Train dot x, train dot y, train dot r, train dot r. And so now I want collide circle circle x1, y1, and then x2, y2.",False,False,good,,,,,,
400,"The question is, is r for actually the radius or is it the diameter?",False,False,good,,,,,,
401,"Does it say circle diameter, circle diameter.",False,False,good,,,,,,
402,So I'm good.,False,False,good,,,,,,
403,"All right, so let's try this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
404,"And then this should really be, oh, this is kind of unfortunate.",False,False,good,,,,,,
405,This should now be an ellipse.,False,False,good,,,,,,
406,"Oh, you know what I can just do?",False,True,bad,,,,,,
407,"I can say ellipse mode corner, perfect.",False,False,good,,,,,,
408,So let's draw the hit circles under train.,False,False,good,,,,,,
409,Let's do the same thing here and say ellipse there.,False,False,good,,,,,,
410,"So this should now, we should see.",False,False,good,,,,,,
411,Here we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
412,That's what it's going to do.,False,False,good,,,,,,
413,"OK, here we go.",False,False,good,,,,,,
414,"Oh, after click.",False,False,good,,,,,,
415,"Oh, what happened?",False,True,bad,,,,,,
416,"All right, I passed r in twice, which is very unnecessary.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
417,"You just give it the diameter, not the radius, even though I'm calling it r once.",False,False,good,,,,,,
418,And let's see what happens.,False,False,good,,,,,,
419,"OK, here we go.",False,False,good,,,,,,
420,Jump.,False,False,good,,,,,,
421,Why is my browser really freaking out?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
422,Let's comment out the debugging.,False,False,good,,,,,,
423,We're just going to go for it now.,False,False,good,,,,,,
424,We're going to play this game and close this tab.,False,False,good,,,,,,
425,Quick Chrome.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
426,We're about to play this game.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
427,"Oh, up.",True,True,good,,,,,,
428,It's up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
429,I'm saying jump.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
430,So up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
431,"Yeah, there we go.",False,False,good,,,,,,
432,Up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
433,Up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
434,Up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
435,"All right, ready, everyone?",True,True,good,,,,,,
436,Up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,

443,Up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
444,Up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
445,Look at me.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
446,I guess I can't use the music.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
447,Up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
448,Up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
449,Up.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
450,Ah.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
451,"All right, everyone.",False,False,good,,,,,,
452,Thus ends this coding challenge.,False,False,good,,,,,,
453,There are so many things that need to be added to this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
454,"Number one, the narrative is makes no sense.",False,False,good,,,,,,
455,Why is there this unicorn standing still?,False,False,good,,,,,,
456,Without any animation.,False,False,good,,,,,,
457,The trains are coming at it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
458,The background should be sort of like in parallax moving.,False,False,good,,,,,,
459,So probably it should be jumping over.,False,False,good,,,,,,
460,I should have just used cacti.,False,False,good,,,,,,
461,"That's the plural of cactus, right?",True,False,bad,,,,,,

58,Now it isn't land dick.,True,True,good,,,,,,
59,"It's not aqua-dick Jerry it's aquatic but if an hippo spend time on land, it is.",True,True,good,,,,,,
60,Now you'd think that they'd live in a place that was wet out of the water like Seattle or London.,False,False,good,,,,,,
61,But no they live in the hottest shit places and that can be problematic in a couple of ways.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
62,First of all the pools dry out and then what are you?,True,True,good,,,,,,
63,Semi mud dick.,True,True,good,,,,,,
64,Jerry I did that for you.,True,True,good,,,,,,
65,But secondly in the heat they have to keep that giant meat potato from overheating.,True,True,good,,,,,,
66,They don't have sweat glands but they do look a bit sweaty don't they?,False,True,bad,,,,,,
67,That's because their skins are creaks amicus.,False,False,good,,,,,,
68,The amicus has a reddish pigment in it called hypo-sideric acid which turns brown as it dries out.,False,False,good,,,,,,
69,This compound acts as a sunscreen but also can fight infection from microorganisms and it's another reason why you don't want to ride a hippo naked.,True,False,bad,,,,,,

86,Now.,False,False,good,,,,,,
87,Curiosity stream has been a long time sponsor of this program.,False,False,good,,,,,,

98,Oh right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
99,"For the most part, hippos eat grasses and shrubbery.",False,False,good,,,,,,
100,"Mostly at night, but that footage sucks.",False,False,good,,,,,,
101,They sort of use their lips to get at it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
102,"All that hardware up front is for fighting, not eating.",False,False,good,,,,,,
103,"To chew, they got to take it all the way back to where the little teeth are.",False,False,good,,,,,,
104,These grasses aren't that nutritious and they're hard to digest.,False,False,good,,,,,,
105,So bacteria in the hippo's stomach ferment and break down those lawn clippings into something that the hippo can work with.,False,False,good,,,,,,
106,"After all that's been taken care of, of course it comes out the other end.",False,False,good,,,,,,
107,Spectacularly.,False,False,good,,,,,,
108,The hippo is not a modest pooper.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
109,Not like a dog sort of looking around guiltily.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
110,It looks like a malfunctioning dodo toilet.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
111,The bedenhozzles on full blast.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
112,The thought is this is for scent marking because it helps disperse the scent.,False,False,good,,,,,,
113,Understatement.,False,False,good,,,,,,
114,But here's the thing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
115,"16 hours a day or so, they're sitting in a pool with a whole bunch of other hippos.",False,False,good,,,,,,
116,"You're shifting around a bit, you don't always know what part of the hippo in front of you you're facing.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
117,"And at some point someone's gonna have to go and it's a pain in the ass to get out, get your flip flops.",True,True,good,,,,,,
118,Because the floor in the pool house toilet is always wet and you don't know from what.,True,True,good,,,,,,
119,"So if someone shits in the pool, you could make a big deal out of it.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
120,Or you could lean into it.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
121,And that's what the hippos did.,False,False,good,,,,,,
122,Make some lemonade out of those lemons.,False,False,good,,,,,,
123,And by lemonade I mean shits soup.,True,True,good,,,,,,
124,And by shits soup I mean shits soup with benefits.,True,True,good,,,,,,
125,Alright that sounds weird.,True,True,good,,,,,,
126,"With all the hippos pooping in the pool, that's good news for all the things that like to eat poop.",True,True,good,,,,,,
127,"But as those creatures thrive, they take oxygen out of the water.",False,False,good,,,,,,
128,And this in turn makes the water resemble the insides of the hippos' gut.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
129,And that means that those healthy bacteria that are living in the gut can come out and play.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
130,And suddenly the water's like a big shared gut.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
131,Everyone's pooping in it and drinking it and officiating it.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
132,I mean it's good bacteria for everyone.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
133,It's like swimming in kombucha.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
134,Or a compupcha.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
135,Get it?,True,True,good,,,,,,
136,Kill me.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
137,And this can change entire ecosystems.,False,False,good,,,,,,
138,The grass is hippozee-er-rich in silica.,False,False,good,,,,,,
139,The silica gets used by diatoms.,False,False,good,,,,,,
140,A kind of algae that encases itself in little glass houses.,False,False,good,,,,,,
141,The diatoms can then out-compete green algae.,False,False,good,,,,,,
142,Which is good because green algae blooms can choke out all the sunlight in the body of water.,False,False,good,,,,,,
143,You want a nice healthy lake?,False,True,bad,,,,,,
144,Have a hippo shit in it.,True,True,good,,,,,,
145,Who knew?,False,False,good,,,,,,
146,But don't start thinking that hippos are just a group of mellow environmentalist river pooping hippies.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
147,"They've got some spunk to- we don't use that word, Jerry.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
148,They've got some attitude.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
149,I mean look at this one.,False,False,good,,,,,,
150,It's chasing a freaking boat.,False,False,good,,,,,,
151,They can gallop underwater.,False,False,good,,,,,,
152,And look it's got a bigger wake than the boat.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
153,I mean they're not bad on land either.,False,False,good,,,,,,
154,Those dense bones they have can support all that weight even in a sprint.,False,False,good,,,,,,
155,And in short stretches they can go 30 miles an hour.,False,False,good,,,,,,
156,I mean look at that thing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
157,Coming at you and that's a guaranteed pant load.,True,True,good,,,,,,
158,Now being a mucus covered giant bulldozer gives you some protection.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
159,But they also have a weaponized face.,False,False,good,,,,,,
160,You know when somebody yawns and then like you have to yawn?,False,True,bad,,,,,,
161,Imagine what it's like for the hippos because their yawn goes on for days.,True,True,good,,,,,,
162,This mouth wide open gesture exposes their canine teeth which can be over two feet long.,False,False,good,,,,,,
163,They never stop growing and they self-sharpen by rubbing against each other.,False,False,good,,,,,,
164,When you put all that together and you have a creature that really doesn't give a fuck. Look at this one.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
165,You know what he's doing?,False,False,good,,,,,,
166,Wait for it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
167,He's fucking with a rhino.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
168,And the rhino doesn't know what the hell's going on.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
169,He's like you sure about this bro.,True,True,good,,,,,,
170,And the hippo keeps at it until it does what you're not supposed to do.,False,False,good,,,,,,
171,Which is turn your backside to a pissed off rhino.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
172,Look at that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
173,Right in the noodle.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
174,However most of the hippos profound tothidity is reserved for other hippos.,False,False,good,,,,,,
175,A single alpha male has the exclusive right to mate with all the females in the pod.,False,False,good,,,,,,
176,Younger horny males hang out on the periphery and take out their sexual frustration on each other.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
177,Now if you're having trouble figuring out who's who you're not alone.,False,False,good,,,,,,
178,It turns out it's not that easy to tell the hippopotamuses from the hippopotamisters.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
179,Come on that's amazing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
180,Well in this shot you can probably tell.,False,False,good,,,,,,
181,And this is essentially what hippopornography looks like.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
182,It's why you don't see very much of it on your websites.,False,False,good,,,,,,
183,I mean you might get a shot of a nostril here there but it's sort of boring.,False,False,good,,,,,,
184,But I suppose don't judge until you've had a hippopotamus on top of yours.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
185,It's so bad.,False,False,good,,,,,,
186,Anyway that's how they do it and you know what happens next.,False,False,good,,,,,,
187,This right here is a mummy hippo in the process of giving birth to a brand new baby.,False,False,good,,,,,,
188,Birth usually happens under the water and the baby needs to learn quick how to come up for air.,False,False,good,,,,,,
189,It's not all that strong yet and it's still learning to hold its breath.,False,False,good,,,,,,
190,So for the time being mummy helps out with the nudge before it sinks back down like a flesh rock.,False,False,good,,,,,,
191,Soon enough though it gets the hang of it.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
192,For the first months the mummy hippo will raise the baby away from the pod for reasons that will be painfully obvious.,False,False,good,,,,,,
193,But for now this is about as sweet as a hippo relationship gets.,False,False,good,,,,,,
194,I mean come on those babies are cute.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
195,And look at pygmy hippo babies.,False,False,good,,,,,,
196,I mean that's off the charts.,False,False,good,,,,,,
197,It's like a gummy bear come to life.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
198,But parenting out there isn't all that easy.,False,False,good,,,,,,
199,No behind that that's a crocodile hot.,True,True,good,,,,,,
200,Hot.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
201,Oh for god's sakes.,True,True,good,,,,,,
202,At this size the babies are still vulnerable to predators that wouldn't take on a full grown hippo.,False,False,good,,,,,,
203,So it's helpful to have a full grown hippo around.,False,False,good,,,,,,
204,Look at the animal watching the whole thing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
205,Like wildlife rubber necking.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
206,It's like suck it leopard.,True,True,good,,,,,,
207,Yeah suck oh shit they're leaving.,True,True,good,,,,,,
208,It's a bit of an incredible adventure out there alone with your mother learning how best to hip a bottom.,False,False,good,,,,,,
209,And after surviving leopards and lions and crocodiles it's time for them to go back and re-enter the pod.,False,False,good,,,,,,
210,Which is perhaps more dangerous than all of what they've been through.,False,False,good,,,,,,
211,Now let's just say that our little friend made it back just fine.,False,False,good,,,,,,
212,But to understand the hippopotamus you should know that many don't.,False,False,good,,,,,,
213,If a new male is taken over the pod it will often kill returning pups.,False,False,good,,,,,,
214,It's a sad thing but a true thing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
215,And that's the thing with these hippos.,False,False,good,,,,,,
216,They alternate between this sort of serene calm and sudden moments of extreme violence.,False,False,good,,,,,,
217,But that sort of unpredictability might be the best way to stay alive.,False,False,good,,,,,,
218,And they have stayed alive.,False,False,good,,,,,,
219,Big buckets of flesh among lions and leopards.,False,False,good,,,,,,
220,And that is just how the hippo do.,False,False,good,,,,,,
221,No Jerry they're not using farts to echolocate.,True,True,good,,,,,,
222,How do I know?,False,False,good,,,,,,
223,For one what are they going to do?,False,False,good,,,,,,
224,Have a bean burrito three hours before they want to find a carrot?,True,True,good,,,,,,
225,They can't just fart on command Jerry.,True,True,good,,,,,,
226,And anyway they know it wasn't a fart.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
227,Well I don't know.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
228,They look for bubbles Jerry.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
229,Do your magic sonar farts not make bubbles?,True,True,good,,,,,,
230,No.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
231,No you cannot use my bathtub.,True,True,good,,,,,,
232,Idiot.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
0," So you might see something I've been working on in the news this week, a road map to pandemic resilience.",False,False,good,,,,,,
1,"And this is a four-real thing that represents a consensus of people with every political belief and expertise, like 
Republicans and Democrats and libertarians, economists and health officials and ethics and civil liberties folks, 
and at least one mathematician, all agreeing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
2,So there's a few ways we could respond to this pandemic.,False,False,good,,,,,,
3,"In the US, we already closed down a lot of stuff for a while, and it's hard.",False,False,good,,,,,,
4,"But now it looks like the curve is starting to flatten, and we know it's going to keep falling in the near term, and 
all of us want to get back to our lives.",False,False,good,,,,,,
5,We don't know exactly what this side of the curve will look like.,False,False,good,,,,,,
6,"You've probably seen versions that are optimistically symmetric, but unrealistic.",False,False,good,,,,,,
7,"It'll probably look less like this, and more like this, which I modeled off of Spain.",False,False,good,,,,,,
8,"Okay, so say we reopen soon, and whoops, that's not ideal.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
9,"Okay, say less affected areas can reopen.",False,False,good,,,,,,
10,"New York is still closed, and then some of us at least get a month of freedom and economic activity before we 
have to reshut down and do it all again.",False,False,good,,,,,,
11,"And again, it would be a reopening roller coaster, and it would at least spread out the cases, but this plan has 
a lot of unknowns.",False,False,good,,,,,,
12,"It wouldn't be back to business as usual when things are open, because businesses won't be able to rely on each 
other to stay open or on their workers to not all fall sick at once.",False,False,good,,,,,,
13,Anywhere could be the next hotspot.,False,False,good,,,,,,
14,It makes it hard to plan and hard to feel safe.,False,False,good,,,,,,
15,So here's another way to respond.,False,False,good,,,,,,
16,"The plan that all these folks agree on is to reopen the economy this summer in four phases, so that the curve 
keeps falling, and we can stay open while protecting your health and civil liberties.",False,False,good,,,,,,
17,There's three things we need to do this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
18,Number one is testing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
19,"We simply need more tests, a lot more, like millions a day, and these tests will be fast.",False,False,good,,,,,,
20,No one wants to wait days for their results.,False,False,good,,,,,,
21,Number two is tracing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
22,"Contact tracing is how we let you know if there's a chance you've been exposed, so you can get a test and find 
out fast whether you should isolate to stop it from spreading further.",False,False,good,,,,,,
23,And number three is supported isolation.,False,False,good,,,,,,
24,"Anyone who tests positive or is waiting for their results needs support isolate at home with health care supplies 
and job protections.",False,False,good,,,,,,
25,So testing tracing supported isolation.,False,False,good,,,,,,
26,"It's possible, but it takes resources.",False,False,good,,,,,,
27,So we made our plan as epic as we needed to be to get this done responsibly this summer.,False,False,good,,,,,,
28,"Okay, so first is phase one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
29,Here's where we see the curve flatten and fall by giving our essential workers the support and care they need.,False,False,good,,,,,,
30,40% of the economy is already open.,False,False,good,,,,,,
31,"Thanks to essential workers like nurses, grocery store workers, utilities maintenance workers, police and 
firefighters, restaurant and delivery workers.",False,False,good,,,,,,
32,"They didn't ask to be put on the front lines of this crisis, but they've stepped up to the challenges.",False,False,good,,,,,,
33,"So in phase one, we grow our resources to support those essential workers and turn our current limited 
economy into a pandemic resilient foundation.",False,False,good,,,,,,
34,"We'll hear from our neighbors and friends who work in delivery and law enforcement that thanks to testing and 
tracing, they don't have to wonder anymore if they might be spreading the disease without even knowing it.",False,False,good,,,,,,
35,And they don't have to worry about co-workers having it without knowing it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
36,"When someone tests positive, they get sick leave, they have other worker protection, so no one is worried 
about getting fired for being sick if they take a test.",False,False,good,,,,,,
37,"We'll hear from our elders and care facilities that now there's testing in place to make sure there's no chance for 
this disease to spread out of control.",False,False,good,,,,,,
38,"That goes for anyone in frequent contact with essential workers, including folks in jails and prisons.",False,False,good,,,,,,
39,"Some folks will be going through online training to fill in for essential workers, maybe a teacher you know 
trained to do in-home childcare to sub in for someone who's gotten ill, and maybe a neighbor who has 
experienced caring for an elderly relative decides to take the course and is ready to fill in.",False,False,good,,,,,,
40,How and where testing gets done might also depend on the community.,False,False,good,,,,,,
41,"We know that the best way to prevent spread is to find out who was in contact with someone who tests 
positive, so that those people can get tested quickly and have results within 24 hours.",False,False,good,,,,,,
42,"Some communities already have networks of contact tracer that people trust to do this work in a way that 
protects their rights.",False,False,good,,,,,,
43,"While in some communities, we might hear about people working together to build these networks.",False,False,good,,,,,,
44,Maybe some will use technology to help.,False,False,good,,,,,,
45,"The better we are at contact tracing, the faster we can move on to phase two.",False,False,good,,,,,,
46,"But worst case, we just have to make a lot more tests.",False,False,good,,,,,,
47,"Because in phase one, most of us are still isolating at home, so we only need to produce enough tests to keep 
those essential workers safe.",False,False,good,,,,,,
48,"Meanwhile, we'll hear about all the innovative ways communities and companies are expanding contact tracing 
and making it work to bring down the number of cases to where we can move to phase two.",False,False,good,,,,,,
49,"In phase two, well, we've got our stable foundation of 40%.",False,False,good,,,,,,
50,So now we expand essential workers to 70%.,False,False,good,,,,,,
51,"Communities will be empowered to put programs in place to train and hire more people in essential jobs, 
lightening the burden on the current essential workforce.",False,False,good,,,,,,
52,We'll be able to address supply chain problems.,False,False,good,,,,,,
53,You can find toilet paper in stores and order pasta online again.,False,False,good,,,,,,
54,"We might see one city get more buses on the street and hire more folks to drive those buses, so that expanded 
essential workers can get to their jobs safely without being in a crowded environment.",False,False,good,,,,,,
55,"Another city without buses to spare might invest in hiring a set of workers to build out more public transit 
infrastructure.",False,False,good,,,,,,
56,"More people will get hired to serve in roles in unemployment and retraining, so more people can access support.",False,False,good,,,,,,
57,A doctor who's tested positive and has to isolate might teach courses on how to do a swab test.,False,False,good,,,,,,
58,"A contact tracer with 20 years experience might partner with their county to start an online training program for 
contact tracers.",False,False,good,,,,,,
59,Maybe the Bay Area leans heavily on appassisted contact tracing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
60,"Maybe LA partners with an organization like Unidos, US, to work with immigrants on community run contact 
tracing they trust.",False,False,good,,,,,,
61,"In a rural county like mine, maybe we do most of our contact tracing the old fashioned way over the phone with 
one of our local figures that everyone already knows anyway, and we can take a test at the old elementary 
school if we need to.",False,False,good,,,,,,
62,Maybe we apply for funding to expand our tiny hospital and there's a demand for construction workers to build it out.,False,False,good,,,,,,
63,"During this phase, which will probably be most of June, we can allow a relaxation of certain social distancing 
measures for those essential workers on the front lines.",False,False,good,,,,,,
64,"We'll still have to cancel large gatherings, but the group of expanded essential workers can safely visit and support 
each other.",False,False,good,,,,,,
65,"We'll see restaurants that are currently doing takeout for the general population can be open to serve essential 
workers on site.",False,False,good,,,,,,
66,"If there's any question of exposure, there's enough tests to find out, and the health resources to respond as necessary.",False,False,good,,,,,,
67,We'll see our friends and relatives in essential sectors go from stress and scared to secure and supported.,False,False,good,,,,,,
68,"Before long, 70% of the population is part of a smoothly working pandemic resilient economy, and so we move on to 
phase three.",False,False,good,,,,,,
69,Phase three is short and sweet.,False,False,good,,,,,,
70,"It gets our workforce back to 100%, though some of us will still be working from home.",False,False,good,,,,,,
71,"It lasts just a week or two, and by the end, there will be no corona-induced unemployment.",False,False,good,,,,,,
72,"Phase three is where non-essential businesses like hair and nail salons work that cannot be done remotely will 
restart with safety precautions like public mask wearing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
73,"Maybe a friend reopens his hair salon, giving priority to essential workers in his community like doctors and bus drivers.",False,False,good,,,,,,
74,"He knows they are able to get testing if there's a chance they've been exposed, so that if any of his clients do test 
positive, he'll be informed by a contact tracer that he should get tested too in case.",False,False,good,,,,,,
75,"He makes sure to only have one client in his shop at a time and take special precautions to clean down surfaces 
between clients.",False,False,good,,,,,,
76,"Office workers and mathematicians like me will still be working from home in phase three and asked not to go 
out for just this next week or two, but now I can get a home visit from a hair colorist or a massage therapist.",False,False,good,,,,,,
77,"I'll leave the on-location visits for the workers who don't have the at-home job security I have, just until we've 
ramped up our supplies to where we can move on to phase four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
78,"Phase three also increases support for the unemployed, homeless, and underhoused.",False,False,good,,,,,,
79,"This phase is probably early July, so I'll be looking to my county for guidance on whether it's safe to have a small 
fourth of July gathering, maybe keeping our distance outside on the porch or following other recommendations.",False,False,good,,,,,,
80,"And then at the end of July, we enter phase four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
81,The last 20% of workers still working from home can start going to the office again.,False,False,good,,,,,,
82,"You might start going in just a few days a week after taking a test, covered by insurance, and then working from home 
for the rest of the week while a different group of workers has in office days.",False,False,good,,,,,,
83,"Some industries might face things differently, and different offices will make different decisions based on guidance 
and resources.",False,False,good,,,,,,
84,"We can plan for summer barbecues with our family and friends, because we'll have clear guidance about safety and 
access to tests.",False,False,good,,,,,,
85,"We can go to parks and go shopping, wearing a mask without fear that coronavirus is lying in weight on every surface.",False,False,good,,,,,,
86,"A restaurant owner in New York where tables are usually spaced close together might have to reduce capacity, but 
they're happy to have office workers able to dine out again.",False,False,good,,,,,,
87,"In my town, maybe most restaurants have enough space that folks can keep a safe distance at about the usual capacity.",False,False,good,,,,,,
88,"Maybe our local club replaces the dance floor with safely spaced bar tables, and they hire local performers to give 
live shows so that they can charge a cover to make up for reduced capacity.",False,False,good,,,,,,
89,"In phase four, students can go back to school.",False,False,good,,,,,,
90,"Well, it's probably summer vacation for most, but some school districts might have summer classes where students 
can get out of the house and catch up on what they missed in spring.",False,False,good,,,,,,
91,Summer sports teams might have to get creative.,False,False,good,,,,,,

29,"In dimension three, we have space.",False,False,good,,,,,,
30,"And then you can think about dimension four, just add another variable, say time.",False,False,good,,,,,,
31,And that's four-dimensional hyper space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
32,"And you can just add more variables, five-dimensional, and six-dimensional, and so on.",False,False,good,,,,,,
33,"It's not something that we can visualize, but we can think of it mathematically anyway.",False,False,good,,,,,,
34,And we can write down equations.,False,False,good,,,,,,

36,Or are manifolds in space themselves?,False,False,good,,,,,,
37,"They can sit in the space, but they could also look like that space around any point.",False,False,good,,,,,,
38,So let me tell you an example.,False,False,good,,,,,,
39,The surface of the Earth is a great example.,False,False,good,,,,,,
40,"It's a sphere, more or less.",False,False,good,,,,,,
41,It's called a geowide.,False,False,good,,,,,,
42,It has mountains and valleys.,False,False,good,,,,,,
43,"But remember, we can all deform them and make it into a sphere.",False,False,good,,,,,,
44,Topological it's a sphere.,False,False,good,,,,,,
45,And it sits in three-dimensional space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
46,"But around any point, it looks like two-dimensional plane.",False,False,good,,,,,,
47,Because I can move basically two directions.,False,False,good,,,,,,
48,"I can move left and right, and forwards and backwards.",False,False,good,,,,,,
49,There are two degrees of freedom.,False,False,good,,,,,,
50,So that's what I'm saying.,False,False,good,,,,,,
51,"That the sphere is a two-dimensional manifold, even though it lives in three-dimensional space.",False,False,good,,,,,,
52,OK. Other examples of two-dimensional manifolds would be the surface of the donut.,False,False,good,,,,,,
53,Or this famous Klein bottle.,False,False,good,,,,,,
54,"Yes, if I live on it, again, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference from a plane.",False,False,good,,,,,,
55,"Just like it's pretty hard to tell the difference between a plane and the Earth, the sphere, from where we are.",False,False,good,,,,,,
56,"To really tell them apart, you would have to go far away and see that you come back.",False,False,good,,,,,,
57,There are also one-dimensional manifolds.,False,False,good,,,,,,
58,Like the circle right here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
59,It's a one-dimensional manifold.,False,False,good,,,,,,
60,"If we only lived on the circle, then we would only have one direction in which to move in.",False,False,good,,,,,,
61,"And then there are three-dimensional manifolds, like our ordinary space or the universe.",False,False,good,,,,,,
62,"Around every point, it looks like we have three dimensions to go into.",False,False,good,,,,,,
63,We also have the bottom and top.,False,False,good,,,,,,
64,But we actually don't know the shape of the universe.,False,False,good,,,,,,
65,It's a three-dimensional manifold.,False,False,good,,,,,,
66,"It could be hyperspace, but it could be what's called a three-dimensional hypersphere.",False,False,good,,,,,,
67,"Perhaps if we go very high up, then we would come back to where we are.",False,False,good,,,,,,
68,"Nobody has done that, but we don't know if it's possible or not.",False,False,good,,,,,,
69,"Just like on the surface of the Earth, when you go around, you come back.",False,False,good,,,,,,
70,So we just know it's a three-dimensional manifold.,False,False,good,,,,,,
71,Is there no way to test for that?,False,False,good,,,,,,
72,"It's strange that we could not know that even the one we're living in, the one we're living and breathing in.",False,False,good,,,,,,
73,That is the only way to test to walk forever and see if I come back.,False,False,good,,,,,,
74,"No, there are other ways.",False,False,good,,,,,,
75,People are looking at the cosmic microwave background radiation.,False,False,good,,,,,,
76,And they have put forward various theories about what the shape of the universe is.,False,False,good,,,,,,
77,But there is no definite theory that everyone accepts.,False,False,good,,,,,,
78,It's not yet known what shape it is.,False,False,good,,,,,,
79,But there are some hints from the universe.,False,False,good,,,,,,
80,"OK, so we have three-dimensional objects, and then we can think about four dimensionals and so on.",False,False,good,,,,,,
81,A good example is this hypersphere.,False,False,good,,,,,,
82,"So in dimension one, we have the circle, which is a one-dimensional manifold, and it's the set of points at the given distance from the origin.",False,False,good,,,,,,
83,It's given by the equation x squared plus y squared equals one.,False,False,good,,,,,,
84,"Similarly, we have this sphere, which is, again, the set of points at distance one from a given point, but it lives in three-dimensional space, and it's given by the equation x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
85,And we can generalize this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
86,"We can talk about the n-dimensional hypersphere, which is given by the equation x1 squared plus dot dot dot plus xn squared plus another variable xn plus one squared equals one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
87,"It lives in n plus one dimensional space, and it's an n-dimensional manifold.",False,False,good,,,,,,
88,"Now I'm getting to the crux of the matter, the exotic objects.",False,False,good,,,,,,
89,What are exotic objects?,False,False,good,,,,,,
90,"These are things that are topologically the same, but are smoothly different.",False,False,good,,,,,,
91,So there are two ways of thinking about the formations in topology.,False,False,good,,,,,,
92,"I showed you before that a circle can be turned into a square, and in the process, of course, you have to make a corner.",False,False,good,,,,,,
93,"Now the circle is smooth, and you can turn it into other smooth curves, like maybe something like an elix, and the process would be smooth.",False,False,good,,,,,,
94,"Now could it be that we have two smooth objects, and you can deform one into the other, but the only way to do so is by making corners somewhere in the middle.",False,False,good,,,,,,
95,"Then those objects would be topologically the same, but smoothly different.",False,False,good,,,,,,
96,"And I don't know, if you're more familiar with one of the objects, you would say that the second one is an exotic copy of the other one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
97,"It's like if you live on the first object and you go to the second one, it's like going to an exotic location.",False,False,good,,,,,,
98,"Some things are the same, but some things are just different.",False,False,good,,,,,,
99,Now how can this be?,False,False,good,,,,,,
100,"How can you have two smooth things, but to deform one into the other, you need to make corners?",False,False,good,,,,,,
101,Here is an example.,False,False,good,,,,,,
102,"We have a figure eight, and can I turn it into a circle?",False,False,good,,,,,,
103,"Well, I can do so if I make one of the loops smaller and smaller, but at some point I have to make a corner, and then it becomes a circle.",False,False,good,,,,,,
104,Now that's not actually a good example.,False,False,good,,,,,,
105,"Because if I had a third dimension, if I allow myself to just lift this up, then it would become a circle just smoothly.",False,False,good,,,,,,
106,So this is not a real example of exotic objects.,False,False,good,,,,,,
107,"In fact, I cannot show you exotic objects, because they don't exist in dimensions one, two, and three, in the dimensions that we can easily visualize.",False,False,good,,,,,,
108,They only start existing in dimension four and higher.,False,False,good,,,,,,
109,"The first examples were found in 1956 by a mathematician called John Melner, and they were found in dimension seven.",False,False,good,,,,,,
110,They are exotic hypersphere of seven dimensions.,False,False,good,,,,,,
111,"So there is some object on exotic sphere that you can deform into the ordinary seven-dimensional sphere, but not smoothly.",False,False,good,,,,,,
112,An exotic sphere is a smooth object that I can deform into a sphere.,False,False,good,,,,,,
113,But I cannot deform it smoothly.,False,False,good,,,,,,
114,I would have to make corners in the middle.,False,False,good,,,,,,
115,Let me show you now the numbers of spheres in each dimension.,False,False,good,,,,,,
116,"In dimension one, two, three, there's just one, the standard one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
117,The same goes in dimensions five and six.,False,False,good,,,,,,
118,"Now in dimension seven, we actually have 28 spheres.",False,False,good,,,,,,
119,"So there's the standard one, and then there are 27 different ones.",False,False,good,,,,,,
120,"Then we have two spheres in dimension eight, then eight, then six, then in dimension eleven, we have 992 spheres.",False,False,good,,,,,,
121,"In dimension twelve, we have just one, then three, then two, then sixteen thousand, then two hundred and fifty-six, and so on.",False,False,good,,,,,,
122,"If you look at the sequence of numbers, it looks strange.",False,False,good,,,,,,
123,"I grant you that, but there are some patterns.",False,False,good,,,,,,
124,"For example, in dimensions seven, eleven, fifteen, every four dimensions, you get a lot more exotic spheres than in the other nearby dimensions.",False,False,good,,,,,,
125,One thing you can ask is in what dimensions do exotics spheres exist?,False,False,good,,,,,,
126,And in what dimensions does just the standard one?,False,False,good,,,,,,
127,"We see that there's just one sphere in dimensions one, two, three, five, six, twelve, and also mathematicians figure it out.",False,False,good,,,,,,
128,The same is true in dimensions fifty-six and sixty-one.,False,False,good,,,,,,
129,"So does that mean if I was an object living in a sixty-one dimensional universe, it's a little bit more boring than some of the other ones?",True,False,bad,,,,,,
130,"That's right, yes, these are the boring dimensions, you don't have exotic spheres.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
131,"Although you do have some other exotic objects in these dimensions, just not spheres.",False,False,good,,,,,,
132,These numbers seem so arbitrary.,False,False,good,,,,,,
133,I assume it's impossible for someone to easily explain why it's certain numbers that are boring and other ones that are hyper exotic.,False,False,good,,,,,,
134,"These numbers are hard to compute, does a whole story involving Bernoulli numbers and homotopic groups of spheres.",False,False,good,,,,,,
135,The most interesting thing about them is that we can compute them in any dimension except in dimension four.,False,False,good,,,,,,
136,That's where I left question mark.,False,False,good,,,,,,
137,That's the biggest mystery.,False,False,good,,,,,,
138,It's one of the most famous open problems in topology.,False,False,good,,,,,,
139,"It's called the four-dimensional smooth-point-correct conjecture, which says that there are no exotic spheres in dimension four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
140,But we don't know that for sure yet.,False,False,good,,,,,,
141,We don't know.,False,False,good,,,,,,
142,There are examples of objects that are smooth and you can deform them into the ordinary four-dimensional sphere by introducing corners.,False,False,good,,,,,,
143,But people don't know if you can do that smoothly or not.,False,False,good,,,,,,
144,I have also looked for exotic four-dimensional sphere myself and I couldn't find any.,False,False,good,,,,,,
145,"If you did, would you become a very famous mathematician?",False,False,good,,,,,,
146,Absolutely.,False,False,good,,,,,,
147,Is it not like a millennium problem?,False,False,good,,,,,,
148,Is it anything or is it?,False,False,good,,,,,,
149,"No, there was a similar conjecture in dimension three, the Poin-correct conjecture.",False,False,good,,,,,,
150,That was the one problem in topology among my millennium problems that was solved by Peralman in 2003.,False,False,good,,,,,,
151,And I think now the most famous remaining open problem in topology is this one about dimension four.,False,False,good,,,,,,
152,But it hasn't yet made it to the list of millennium problems.,False,False,good,,,,,,
153,"Professor, don't waste your time making numberphile videos.",True,True,good,,,,,,
154,You need to go upstairs and solve this problem.,True,False,bad,,,,,,
155,"Numberphile videos are important, too.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
156,All right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
157,So why is dimension four so difficult?,False,False,good,,,,,,
158,Good question.,False,False,good,,,,,,
159,"Well, it's more difficult than the lower dimensions.",False,False,good,,,,,,
160,"One, two, three becomes in those dimensions we can see things.",False,False,good,,,,,,
161,And there are also geometric techniques that mathematicians use to study shapes in these dimensions.,False,False,good,,,,,,
162,"What's interesting is that it's also simpler than dimensions five, six, and greater.",False,False,good,,,,,,
163,And the reason for that is a trick about separating disks.,False,False,good,,,,,,
164,"To explain it, let me say one way in which topologists distinguish between shapes.",False,False,good,,,,,,
165,"If I have a lasso and I throw it somewhere on the plane or even on the surface of the earth, which is a sphere, it would surround a region.",False,False,good,,,,,,
166,So I could just contract it into a blob around a little point.,False,False,good,,,,,,
167,"But if I have the same lasso and I would put it around the surface around the hole in a donut, then I wouldn't be able to contract it without breaking the donut.",False,False,good,,,,,,
168,And that's one way you can tell the donut apart from the sphere.,False,False,good,,,,,,
169,"So to study these objects, mathematicians are looking at loops and how you contract them.",False,False,good,,,,,,
170,And the contraction spans a disk.,False,False,good,,,,,,
171,A disk is a two-dimensional object.,False,False,good,,,,,,
172,And it's easier to study these objects if you can split apart the disks so that you can study each complication one at a time.,False,False,good,,,,,,
173,"All right, how can you split apart disks?",False,False,good,,,,,,
174,"Well, let me start with lines.",False,False,good,,,,,,
175,"If I have two lines and they're on the plane and they intersect, if I move one a little bit, I'm not going to be able to take it off the other.",False,False,good,,,,,,
176,But I can take it off if I allow myself to go into space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
177,The reason is that three is greater than one plus one.,False,False,good,,,,,,
178,"Each line is a one-dimensional object and one plus one is two, but I have one extra dimension.",False,False,good,,,,,,
179,And that's why I can do it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
180,"Similarly, if I'm interested in separating disks, each disk is a two-dimensional object and two plus two is four, so I need one extra dimension.",False,False,good,,,,,,
181,"So in dimensions five and higher, I can separate disks.",False,False,good,,,,,,
182,And that just makes topological objects easier to study.,False,False,good,,,,,,
183,This is called the Whitney trick and it led to the classification of smooth manifolds in higher dimensions back in the 60s.,False,False,good,,,,,,
184,And this is the problem with dimension four.,False,False,good,,,,,,
185,"You can't, in dimension four, you haven't got the space to separate two disks.",False,False,good,,,,,,
186,That's right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
187,We don't have the geometric methods from lower dimensions and we don't have the trick about separating disks.,False,False,good,,,,,,
188,And that makes dimension four the hardest to wrap our heads around.,False,False,good,,,,,,
189,"To give you an example of something that's unique to dimension four, instead of looking at exotic spheres, let's look at exotic hyperspaces.",False,False,good,,,,,,
190,"Remember, we had the line and then the plane and then the space.",False,False,good,,,,,,
191,"And in end dimensions, we have the hyperspace.",False,False,good,,,,,,
192,So could you have an exotic hyperspace?,False,False,good,,,,,,
193,"Something that looks like a plane or a space and you can deform it into the ordinary one, but only by making corners.",False,False,good,,,,,,
194,Here are the numbers of hyperspaces in each dimension.,False,False,good,,,,,,
195,"In any dimension except four, there is just one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
196,There's just a standard one and there are no exotic hyperspaces.,False,False,good,,,,,,
197,"But in dimension four, we have infinitely many.",False,False,good,,,,,,
198,"In fact, it's more than infinitely many.",False,False,good,,,,,,
199,It's uncountably many.,False,False,good,,,,,,
200,"It's not the kind of infinity that you can count, one, two, three and so on.",False,False,good,,,,,,
201,It's as many exotic hyperspaces as there are real numbers.,False,False,good,,,,,,
202,And this doesn't happen in any other dimensions.,False,False,good,,,,,,
203,"If you have exotic objects in some other dimensions, you know that there are always finitely many of them.",False,False,good,,,,,,
204,"There's finitely many exotic spheres, so as I showed you that list of numbers.",False,False,good,,,,,,
205,"But in dimension four, you can have infinitely many exotic objects.",False,False,good,,,,,,
206,"And yeah, that's what makes dimension four so fascinating.",False,False,good,,,,,,
207,Does this mean dimension four is something that you should be spending more time on because it's so special?,False,False,good,,,,,,
208,Or is this a sign that maybe this is a bit of an aberration that you should leave alone?,False,False,good,,,,,,
209,It's a place where you shouldn't play.,False,False,good,,,,,,
210,That depends on your own perspective.,False,False,good,,,,,,
211,There are mathematicians who work on the other dimensions.,False,False,good,,,,,,
212,And there are mathematicians that work on dimension four.,False,False,good,,,,,,
213,I'm in the latter category.,False,False,good,,,,,,
214,"Because quite often when I speak to number theorists, and they talk to me about prime numbers, and they're showing me some interesting property of prime numbers, they very often discard two.",False,False,good,,,,,,
215,"They say, we're not going to use two because that's an aberration.",False,False,good,,,,,,
216,And it ruins everything.,False,False,good,,,,,,
217,It ruins all our laws and principles on that.,False,False,good,,,,,,
218,And they just throw it aside.,False,False,good,,,,,,
219,It sounds like the fourth dimension is your equivalent.,False,False,good,,,,,,
220,That's pretty much it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
221,"In many theorems, you say this is happening in all dimensions except four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
222,And we understand what's happening.,False,False,good,,,,,,
223,And we just don't know what's happening in dimension four.,False,False,good,,,,,,
224,But I find that interesting and worthy of study.,False,False,good,,,,,,
