0,hello and welcome to another coding challenge,False,False,good,246.0,56.0,0.81,0.85,0.94,0.89
1,well i m excited about this one,False,False,good,,,,,,
2,in this coding challenge i m going to attempt to make this fern,False,True,bad,,,,,,
3,the barnsley fern named for the british mathematician michael barnsley,False,False,good,,,,,,
4,i encourage you to read this wikipedia page which will give you more background on it,False,False,good,,,,,,
5,what i m going to do is just look at the algorithm and try to write that algorithm into code and see if we can get that result,False,False,good,,,,,,
6,and then you the creative viewer of this coding challenge will make your own version with different colors,False,False,good,,,,,,
7,and you will think about animating it and do all sorts of things that i could not possibly even imagine,False,True,bad,,,,,,
8,so for what is the algorithm here,False,False,good,,,,,,
9,so if we look down here i m just going to skip down down here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
10,it says the first point is drawn at the origin x equals y equals,False,False,good,,,,,,
11,so what this means is where you need some sort of two dimensional space,False,False,good,,,,,,
12,it could be a processing canvas and i want to start at,False,False,good,,,,,,
13,now i m going to think of in the center here,False,False,good,,,,,,
14,and i m going to have to probably figure out some ways of well the pixels are here but then on the pixel spaces here,False,False,good,,,,,,
15,but i m not going to worry about that right now,False,False,good,,,,,,
16,and then what is the next step,False,False,good,,,,,,
17,the next step is and then the new points are iteratively computed by randomly applying one of the four following coordinate transformations,False,False,good,,,,,,
18,and here they are to find out this is the kind of stuff that you might see and think ahh ok i m going to go do something else,False,True,bad,,,,,,
19,this looks like matrix math and linear algebra,False,False,good,,,,,,
20,but this is actually first of all if you watch some of my matrix videos this is going to strangely enough make sense to you,True,True,good,,,,,,
21,but let me actually show you that this math is actually quite simple,False,False,good,,,,,,
22,let s use just this second one and let us rewrite this over on the board,False,False,good,,,,,,
23,so f of x y equals so i m going to have to go back and check it haha,True,True,good,,,,,,
24,,False,False,good,,,,,,
25,negative negative i should have made up my own numbers haha,True,True,good,,,,,,
26,,False,False,good,,,,,,
27,then we have x y oh no i m running out of space,False,True,bad,,,,,,
28,i m running out of space,False,True,bad,,,,,,
29,plus i can put this in,False,True,bad,,,,,,
30,you can see that and,False,False,good,,,,,,
31,what does this mean,False,False,good,,,,,,
32,well this is actually the matrix product or the matrix multiplication or the dot product,False,False,good,,,,,,
33,what it means is i want to find the values,False,False,good,,,,,,
34,if this is x y what i want to get is the next values for x,False,False,good,,,,,,
35,so i have one point and i want to know where does that point go,False,False,good,,,,,,
36,what s x y,False,False,good,,,,,,
37,so this being x equals this number times that sorry times x plus this number times that the row gets multiplied by the column times y,False,False,good,,,,,,
38,and then plus this number plus,False,False,good,,,,,,
39,and then y then equals negative times x plus and my handwriting s terrible times y this column times this column plus,False,True,bad,,,,,,
40,so it is really just this formula,False,False,good,,,,,,
41,if i have an xy coordinate i get the next xy coordinate with this math,False,False,good,,,,,,
42,and we can just double check that this is right,False,False,good,,,,,,
43,look at that for a second with my horrible messy handwriting,True,True,good,,,,,,
44,and then let us go down here and see look at this,False,False,good,,,,,,
45,it s the same thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
46,x the next x is this number times the previous x plus this number times the previous y,False,False,good,,,,,,
47,and the next y is this number times the previous x plus this number times the previous y plus,False,False,good,,,,,,
48,so we just need to do one of these four,False,False,good,,,,,,
49,and each one of those four we do according to a particular probability,False,False,good,,,,,,
50,right,False,False,good,,,,,,
51,oh right abcde,False,False,good,,,,,,
52,yep that could have written it this way,True,False,bad,,,,,,
53,that s the generic way of writing,False,True,bad,,,,,,
54,okay so all right so let us go back into that let us start writing some code,False,True,bad,,,,,,
55,all right so i have a processing sketch a java based programming environment with a nice api for drawing stuff and lots more processing,False,False,good,,,,,,
56,i m going to say background equals zero,False,False,good,,,,,,
57,i m going to have an x and a y i m going to set those to be zero to start,False,False,good,,,,,,
58,i m going to draw i m going to say stroke,False,False,good,,,,,,
59,,False,False,good,,,,,,
60,stroke weight,False,False,good,,,,,,
61,sorry stroke stroke weight eight,False,False,good,,,,,,
62,and then i m going to draw a point at x point y,False,False,good,,,,,,
63,ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
64,and then what i need to do is get the next value,False,False,good,,,,,,
65,so next x equals some number a times x plus b times y plus c and actually so let us just use these numbers here,False,False,good,,,,,,
66,let s just copy these,False,False,good,,,,,,
67,,False,False,good,,,,,,
68,,False,False,good,,,,,,
69,negative,False,False,good,,,,,,
70,negative,False,False,good,,,,,,
71,and next y is negative,False,False,good,,,,,,
72,,False,False,good,,,,,,
73,,False,False,good,,,,,,
74,,False,False,good,,,,,,
75,,False,False,good,,,,,,
76,,False,False,good,,,,,,
77,no what is going on,False,True,bad,,,,,,
78,ok everything s fine now,False,True,bad,,,,,,
79,breathe everybody,False,True,bad,,,,,,
80,breathe would be,False,True,bad,,,,,,
81,okay so this is applying that particular transformation,False,False,good,,,,,,
82,and then i could just say x equals next x y equals next y,False,False,good,,,,,,
83,so what if i were to do this and run this,False,False,good,,,,,,
84,i do not get any errors,False,False,good,,,,,,
85,so i do see this circle over here being drawn,False,False,good,,,,,,
86,so here s the thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
87,i m only applying one of those transformations,False,False,good,,,,,,
88,i need to pick one of four,False,False,good,,,,,,
89,and i also am not thinking sort of thoughtfully about the pixel space,False,False,good,,,,,,
90,so i need to do a mapping right,False,False,good,,,,,,
91,x with pixels goes from to to,False,False,good,,,,,,
92,but maybe i want to think of this as a space between negative and and negative and,False,False,good,,,,,,
93,so what i want to do is say when i actually go to draw it pixel x equals map x which goes between negative and to and width and pixel y between negative and,False,False,good,,,,,,
94,and i m going to flip the axis height,False,False,good,,,,,,
95,and then i m going to draw the point at px py,False,False,good,,,,,,
96,let s run this,False,False,good,,,,,,
97,and then oh okay and then i only want to draw the background once,False,False,good,,,,,,
98,and we can see there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
99,so if i apply that transformation over and over again we can see the point going up that way,False,False,good,,,,,,
100,now is that right,False,False,good,,,,,,
101,that looked weird to me,False,True,bad,,,,,,
102,this has to be y,False,False,good,,,,,,
103,yes this needs to be y i was like mapping the x value,False,False,good,,,,,,
104,i was like why is it uh alright,True,True,good,,,,,,
105,so uh mmm alright,True,True,good,,,,,,
106,it s not moving very much but that is fine,False,False,good,,,,,,
107,i m just applying this one transformation,False,False,good,,,,,,
108,alright let us look at the values,False,False,good,,,,,,
109,just to sort of see what those values are doing,False,False,good,,,,,,
110,and we can see there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
111,now it kind of settled,False,False,good,,,,,,
112,interestingly enough it settled to a fixed point,False,False,good,,,,,,
113,hmm,False,False,good,,,,,,
114,but here s the thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
115,we need to do one of four transformations,False,False,good,,,,,,
116,so i need to do the tedious thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
117,now i could probably write the encode these into arrays and like automatically,False,False,good,,,,,,
118,but i m going to do this in a very long winded way,False,True,bad,,,,,,
119,just to see the code,False,False,good,,,,,,
120,i m going to have four of these possibilities,False,False,good,,,,,,
121,so this is actually number two,False,False,good,,,,,,
122,i need to have one,False,False,good,,,,,,
123,i need to have three,False,False,good,,,,,,
124,and i need to have four,False,False,good,,,,,,
125,and i probably should put these in a function,False,False,good,,,,,,
126,but oh there is so many ways i could organize the code to be better,False,True,bad,,,,,,
127,but i m going to just do it this way right now,False,True,bad,,,,,,
128,and i m going to maybe i ll refactor it all later let you do that,True,True,good,,,,,,
129,so let us go back and look at the algorithm,False,False,good,,,,,,
130,this is just zero and point one six times y,False,False,good,,,,,,
131,so this one is actually just zero,False,False,good,,,,,,
132,and this is actually just zero point one zero point one six times y,False,False,good,,,,,,
133,that s option number one,False,False,good,,,,,,
134,option number two we did,False,False,good,,,,,,
135,option number three,False,False,good,,,,,,
136,option number three is point two negative point two six point two negative zero point two six,False,False,good,,,,,,
137,and then point two three point two two one point six,False,False,good,,,,,,
138,point two three point two two two point six what that what it was,False,False,good,,,,,,
139,one point six,False,False,good,,,,,,
140,and then option number four is negative point one five point two eight,False,False,good,,,,,,
141,you re really watching me do this,False,True,bad,,,,,,
142,negative one five and two eight,False,False,good,,,,,,
143,that s not right,False,False,good,,,,,,
144,yeah it is right,False,True,bad,,,,,,
145,and then two six two four four four,False,False,good,,,,,,
146,two six two four four four four,False,False,good,,,,,,
147,let s auto format all this,False,False,good,,,,,,
148,okay now this is the really important part,False,True,bad,,,,,,
149,i need everything to line up,False,True,bad,,,,,,
150,it s not lining up the way i wanted to,False,True,bad,,,,,,
151,help me line up,False,True,bad,,,,,,
152,no no this plus has to go here,False,True,bad,,,,,,
153,this has to go there,False,True,bad,,,,,,
154,that s ok now,False,True,bad,,,,,,
155,this is ok,True,True,good,,,,,,
156,that s fine,False,True,bad,,,,,,
157,that s fine,False,True,bad,,,,,,
158,ok it is fine now,False,True,bad,,,,,,
159,everything s okay everybody,False,True,bad,,,,,,
160,oh wait no no no,False,True,bad,,,,,,
161,i need a zero here,False,False,good,,,,,,
162,definitely need a zero there,True,False,bad,,,,,,
163,ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
164,what s wrong,False,False,good,,,,,,
165,oh no no,False,False,good,,,,,,
166,these have to go over because there is no negative there,False,False,good,,,,,,
167,oh and this has yeah i do not like this,True,True,good,,,,,,
168,this has to go over too,False,False,good,,,,,,
169,yes yes,False,False,good,,,,,,
170,ok this has to go over,False,False,good,,,,,,
171,there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
172,ok that is much better now,True,False,bad,,,,,,
173,now the other thing is i m just going to say float next x,True,False,bad,,,,,,
174,float next y,False,False,good,,,,,,
175,and then i m going to because i just wanted to clear the variables once,False,False,good,,,,,,
176,i m going to get rid of all of these,False,False,good,,,,,,
177,yes you are watching me do this in the most tedious ridiculous way possible,True,True,good,,,,,,
178,but it is good this is good for you,False,True,bad,,,,,,
179,because you are in your frustration and like oh i got a lot,True,True,good,,,,,,
180,you re going to you are going to improve your coding skills by doing it in a different way,False,True,bad,,,,,,
181,watching me and my poor poor poor way of doing this,False,True,bad,,,,,,
182,ok,False,True,bad,,,,,,
183,so this is good,True,False,bad,,,,,,
184,now i need to now i m going to pick a random number,False,False,good,,,,,,
185,and i m just going to say i m going to just do this,False,False,good,,,,,,
186,if r is less i m going to i m going to do a one out of four chance for each of these,False,False,good,,,,,,
187,if r is less than do this,False,False,good,,,,,,
188,otherwise if r is less than do this one,False,False,good,,,,,,
189,otherwise otherwise if r is less than do this one,False,False,good,,,,,,
190,and then otherwise do the last one,False,False,good,,,,,,
191,so now i m just doing a one out of four chance of doing any of these,True,False,bad,,,,,,
192,ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
193,so let s all right,False,False,good,,,,,,
194,so let us run this and see what happens,False,False,good,,,,,,
195,we re not going to get the fern,False,False,good,,,,,,
196,but we should get ooh look at this,False,False,good,,,,,,
197,i m getting something,False,False,good,,,,,,
198,it s just look at this,False,False,good,,,,,,
199,oh it might even be like two,True,False,bad,,,,,,
200,it s just look at this,False,False,good,,,,,,
201,oh it might even be like tree like,False,False,good,,,,,,
202,so one thing i want to do is i want to pick the i want to take this which is like sort of like next point,True,False,bad,,,,,,
203,and i m going to put that into its own function next point,False,False,good,,,,,,
204,so that i can because i m i m probably going to want to also do this,False,False,good,,,,,,
205,oh and then i m going to take this and draw a point,False,False,good,,,,,,
206,and then because i might want to do these multiple times in draw,False,False,good,,,,,,
207,so i think just and i could probably do this in an object oriented way,False,False,good,,,,,,
208,i should probably store it in a ray of all the points,False,False,good,,,,,,
209,but let us just look at this,False,False,good,,,,,,
210,so now let s let me let this go a little faster,False,False,good,,,,,,
211,let me say do a hundred of these transformations per frame,False,False,good,,,,,,
212,and we can see and by the way should be at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
213,i am now sort of figuring out,False,False,good,,,,,,
214,so i m going to put at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
215,so i m going to map this from a two two down to,False,False,good,,,,,,
216,right,False,False,good,,,,,,
217,oh whoa i did that,True,True,good,,,,,,
218,no to i mean,True,False,bad,,,,,,
219,to,False,False,good,,,,,,
220,there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
221,so here s my weird tree thing that i m making without being thoughtful about those probabilities,False,True,bad,,,,,,
222,let s go look at the wikipedia page for those probabilities,False,False,good,,,,,,
223,and you can see they are actually right here in this table,False,False,good,,,,,,
224,so this table is actually defining all those coefficients,False,False,good,,,,,,
225,and here in repeat probability,False,False,good,,,,,,
226,so we have a chance of the first one chance of the second chance of the third and chance of the fourth,False,False,good,,,,,,
227,so i m actually going to put this i m going to amazingly do this in an array,False,True,bad,,,,,,
228,well actually so so okay,True,True,good,,,,,,
229,so there is let us think about this,False,False,good,,,,,,
230,back here,False,False,good,,,,,,
231,there s a chance of this first one,False,False,good,,,,,,
232,so i know that should be this,False,False,good,,,,,,
233,now i want to have an chance of this second one,False,False,good,,,,,,
234,so now i actually need to look and see is it less than,False,False,good,,,,,,
235,because if it is less than that is a chance,False,False,good,,,,,,
236,and between and is,False,False,good,,,,,,
237,then i need to do less than right,False,False,good,,,,,,
238,because there is a chance of this third one,False,False,good,,,,,,
239,and in all other cases the fourth one,False,False,good,,,,,,
240,so let us look at this now,False,False,good,,,,,,
241,and are we going to get a barnsley firm,False,False,good,,,,,,
242,this is looking pretty good,True,True,good,,,,,,
243,now everything s like way off the screen right,True,True,good,,,,,,
244,because i was not proud,False,True,bad,,,,,,
245,i was like oh that ll just make up between negative and,True,False,bad,,,,,,
246,but you might have noticed remember the jazz timing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
247,plus,True,False,bad,,,,,,
248,so clearly the point can go further than that,False,False,good,,,,,,
249,so let us give ourselves some more space,False,False,good,,,,,,
250,so where are the mappings,False,False,good,,,,,,
251,the mappings are here,False,False,good,,,,,,
252,let s go from to,False,False,good,,,,,,
253,and let us try negative to,False,False,good,,,,,,
254,and let us make the stroke weight a little bit less,False,False,good,,,,,,
255,let s give ourselves much more space,False,False,good,,,,,,
256,oh look at that,False,True,bad,,,,,,
257,beauty us ness,False,True,bad,,,,,,
258,barnsley firm,False,False,good,,,,,,
259,that looks about right,False,False,good,,,,,,
260,ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
261,so i m done,False,False,good,,,,,,
262,even though i want to do so much more,False,False,good,,,,,,
263,but i m not going to,False,False,good,,,,,,
264,i m going to let you do more,False,False,good,,,,,,
265,because what can you how could you animate this,False,False,good,,,,,,
266,how could you pick color,False,False,good,,,,,,
267,how could you consider the space,False,False,good,,,,,,
268,how could you connect the points,False,False,good,,,,,,
269,how could you render this in a different way,False,False,good,,,,,,
270,there s so many possibilities,False,False,good,,,,,,
271,but i m going to leave this at this,False,False,good,,,,,,
272,i ve just done the core algorithm,False,False,good,,,,,,
273,and we have this barnsley firm,False,False,good,,,,,,
274,and you know you can by the way you can draw,False,False,good,,,,,,
275,you can see here s variations of this,False,False,good,,,,,,
276,why is mine kind of different than this though,True,False,bad,,,,,,
277,so first of all i m discovering here,False,False,good,,,,,,
278,this is actually giving me the correct range,False,False,good,,,,,,
279,so let us actually do this range,False,False,good,,,,,,
280,let s go into the code and implement the range that was on the wikipedia page,False,False,good,,,,,,
281,so negative,False,False,good,,,,,,
282,to there,False,False,good,,,,,,
283,and then zero to let us try this,False,False,good,,,,,,
284,there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
285,ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
286,so i was not mapping the proper range,False,False,good,,,,,,
287,so it did not curve to the right,False,False,good,,,,,,
288,but now i am mapping the full barnsley firm,False,True,bad,,,,,,
289,thank you very much,False,False,good,,,,,,
290,i really want to make it rainbow color and do other stuff,False,False,good,,,,,,
291,but we have completed it,False,False,good,,,,,,
292,this is the barnsley firm fractal in processing in about three hours and minutes,False,False,good,,,,,,
293,thanks for watching this entire video,False,False,good,,,,,,
294,and i hope you make a variation of this in some way that i could not possibly imagine,False,False,good,,,,,,
295,and share it with me,False,False,good,,,,,,
296,share it in the comments,False,False,good,,,,,,
297,there s a way you can go to the coding and submit a link to your contribution,False,False,good,,,,,,
298,and on twitter at shift minarets the coding train,True,False,bad,,,,,,
299,ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
300,thanks,False,False,good,,,,,,
301,and i will see you all in the next coding challenge,False,False,good,,,,,,
