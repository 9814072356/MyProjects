4,but recently they figured out that their closest relatives are the cetaceans,False,False,good,,,
5,the friggin whales and dolphins,True,False,bad,,,

20,i mean for not knowing how to swim they are quite graceful,True,True,good,,,
21,in part it is because they are sort of a perfect mixture of heavy and buoyant,False,True,bad,,,
22,they re heavy because they have these ultra dense bones,False,False,good,,,
23,and that is good because without them they would have some buoyancy stability problems,False,True,bad,,,
24,but with all that fat in those big lungs they would roll around like a meat beach ball down there,True,True,good,,,
25,but as it is it is almost perfect like they are walking on the moon,True,False,bad,,,
26,but the hippo is not fully aquatic it is semi aquatic which means it does it half ass literally,True,True,good,,,

38,where the trick is when they are relaxed they are closed,False,True,bad,,,
39,this is similar to the dolphins blowhole which is just a pair of nostrils that joined up and went to the top,False,True,bad,,,
40,so every time they want to take a breath they have to flare their nostrils,False,True,bad,,,
41,is it just me here does that look like an evil muppet,True,True,good,,,
42,the good thing is it helps keep the water out,False,True,bad,,,

59,now it is not land dick,True,True,good,,,
60,it s not aqua dick jerry it is aquatic but if an hippo spend time on land it is,True,True,good,,,
