" So you might see something I've been working on in the news this week, a road map to pandemic resilience.",False,False,good,110.0,16.0,0.873015873015873,0.0,0.0,0.0
"And this is a four-real thing that represents a consensus of people with every political belief and expertise, like 
Republicans and Democrats and libertarians, economists and health officials and ethics and civil liberties folks, 
and at least one mathematician, all agreeing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
So there's a few ways we could respond to this pandemic.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"In the US, we already closed down a lot of stuff for a while, and it's hard.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"But now it looks like the curve is starting to flatten, and we know it's going to keep falling in the near term, and 
all of us want to get back to our lives.",False,False,good,,,,,,
We don't know exactly what this side of the curve will look like.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"You've probably seen versions that are optimistically symmetric, but unrealistic.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"It'll probably look less like this, and more like this, which I modeled off of Spain.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Okay, so say we reopen soon, and whoops, that's not ideal.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Okay, say less affected areas can reopen.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"New York is still closed, and then some of us at least get a month of freedom and economic activity before we 
have to reshut down and do it all again.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And again, it would be a reopening roller coaster, and it would at least spread out the cases, but this plan has 
a lot of unknowns.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"It wouldn't be back to business as usual when things are open, because businesses won't be able to rely on each 
other to stay open or on their workers to not all fall sick at once.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Anywhere could be the next hotspot.,False,False,good,,,,,,
It makes it hard to plan and hard to feel safe.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So here's another way to respond.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"The plan that all these folks agree on is to reopen the economy this summer in four phases, so that the curve 
keeps falling, and we can stay open while protecting your health and civil liberties.",False,False,good,,,,,,
There's three things we need to do this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Number one is testing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"We simply need more tests, a lot more, like millions a day, and these tests will be fast.",False,False,good,,,,,,
No one wants to wait days for their results.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Number two is tracing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Contact tracing is how we let you know if there's a chance you've been exposed, so you can get a test and find 
out fast whether you should isolate to stop it from spreading further.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And number three is supported isolation.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Anyone who tests positive or is waiting for their results needs support isolate at home with health care supplies 
and job protections.",False,False,good,,,,,,
So testing tracing supported isolation.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"It's possible, but it takes resources.",False,False,good,,,,,,
So we made our plan as epic as we needed to be to get this done responsibly this summer.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Okay, so first is phase one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Here's where we see the curve flatten and fall by giving our essential workers the support and care they need.,False,False,good,,,,,,
40% of the economy is already open.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Thanks to essential workers like nurses, grocery store workers, utilities maintenance workers, police and 
firefighters, restaurant and delivery workers.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"They didn't ask to be put on the front lines of this crisis, but they've stepped up to the challenges.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So in phase one, we grow our resources to support those essential workers and turn our current limited 
economy into a pandemic resilient foundation.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"We'll hear from our neighbors and friends who work in delivery and law enforcement that thanks to testing and 
tracing, they don't have to wonder anymore if they might be spreading the disease without even knowing it.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And they don't have to worry about co-workers having it without knowing it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"When someone tests positive, they get sick leave, they have other worker protection, so no one is worried 
about getting fired for being sick if they take a test.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"We'll hear from our elders and care facilities that now there's testing in place to make sure there's no chance for 
this disease to spread out of control.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"That goes for anyone in frequent contact with essential workers, including folks in jails and prisons.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Some folks will be going through online training to fill in for essential workers, maybe a teacher you know 
trained to do in-home childcare to sub in for someone who's gotten ill, and maybe a neighbor who has 
experienced caring for an elderly relative decides to take the course and is ready to fill in.",False,False,good,,,,,,
How and where testing gets done might also depend on the community.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"We know that the best way to prevent spread is to find out who was in contact with someone who tests 
positive, so that those people can get tested quickly and have results within 24 hours.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Some communities already have networks of contact tracer that people trust to do this work in a way that 
protects their rights.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"While in some communities, we might hear about people working together to build these networks.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Maybe some will use technology to help.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"The better we are at contact tracing, the faster we can move on to phase two.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"But worst case, we just have to make a lot more tests.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Because in phase one, most of us are still isolating at home, so we only need to produce enough tests to keep 
those essential workers safe.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Meanwhile, we'll hear about all the innovative ways communities and companies are expanding contact tracing 
and making it work to bring down the number of cases to where we can move to phase two.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"In phase two, well, we've got our stable foundation of 40%.",False,False,good,,,,,,
So now we expand essential workers to 70%.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Communities will be empowered to put programs in place to train and hire more people in essential jobs, 
lightening the burden on the current essential workforce.",False,False,good,,,,,,
We'll be able to address supply chain problems.,False,False,good,,,,,,
You can find toilet paper in stores and order pasta online again.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"We might see one city get more buses on the street and hire more folks to drive those buses, so that expanded 
essential workers can get to their jobs safely without being in a crowded environment.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Another city without buses to spare might invest in hiring a set of workers to build out more public transit 
infrastructure.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"More people will get hired to serve in roles in unemployment and retraining, so more people can access support.",False,False,good,,,,,,
A doctor who's tested positive and has to isolate might teach courses on how to do a swab test.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"A contact tracer with 20 years experience might partner with their county to start an online training program for 
contact tracers.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Maybe the Bay Area leans heavily on appassisted contact tracing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Maybe LA partners with an organization like Unidos, US, to work with immigrants on community run contact 
tracing they trust.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"In a rural county like mine, maybe we do most of our contact tracing the old fashioned way over the phone with 
one of our local figures that everyone already knows anyway, and we can take a test at the old elementary 
school if we need to.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
Maybe we apply for funding to expand our tiny hospital and there's a demand for construction workers to build it out.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"During this phase, which will probably be most of June, we can allow a relaxation of certain social distancing 
measures for those essential workers on the front lines.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"We'll still have to cancel large gatherings, but the group of expanded essential workers can safely visit and support 
each other.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"We'll see restaurants that are currently doing takeout for the general population can be open to serve essential 
workers on site.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"If there's any question of exposure, there's enough tests to find out, and the health resources to respond as necessary.",False,False,good,,,,,,
We'll see our friends and relatives in essential sectors go from stress and scared to secure and supported.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Before long, 70% of the population is part of a smoothly working pandemic resilient economy, and so we move on to 
phase three.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Phase three is short and sweet.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"It gets our workforce back to 100%, though some of us will still be working from home.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"It lasts just a week or two, and by the end, there will be no corona-induced unemployment.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Phase three is where non-essential businesses like hair and nail salons work that cannot be done remotely will 
restart with safety precautions like public mask wearing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Maybe a friend reopens his hair salon, giving priority to essential workers in his community like doctors and bus drivers.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"He knows they are able to get testing if there's a chance they've been exposed, so that if any of his clients do test 
positive, he'll be informed by a contact tracer that he should get tested too in case.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"He makes sure to only have one client in his shop at a time and take special precautions to clean down surfaces 
between clients.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Office workers and mathematicians like me will still be working from home in phase three and asked not to go 
out for just this next week or two, but now I can get a home visit from a hair colorist or a massage therapist.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"I'll leave the on-location visits for the workers who don't have the at-home job security I have, just until we've 
ramped up our supplies to where we can move on to phase four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Phase three also increases support for the unemployed, homeless, and underhoused.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"This phase is probably early July, so I'll be looking to my county for guidance on whether it's safe to have a small 
fourth of July gathering, maybe keeping our distance outside on the porch or following other recommendations.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"And then at the end of July, we enter phase four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
The last 20% of workers still working from home can start going to the office again.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"You might start going in just a few days a week after taking a test, covered by insurance, and then working from home 
for the rest of the week while a different group of workers has in office days.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Some industries might face things differently, and different offices will make different decisions based on guidance 
and resources.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"We can plan for summer barbecues with our family and friends, because we'll have clear guidance about safety and 
access to tests.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"We can go to parks and go shopping, wearing a mask without fear that coronavirus is lying in weight on every surface.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"A restaurant owner in New York where tables are usually spaced close together might have to reduce capacity, but 
they're happy to have office workers able to dine out again.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"In my town, maybe most restaurants have enough space that folks can keep a safe distance at about the usual capacity.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Maybe our local club replaces the dance floor with safely spaced bar tables, and they hire local performers to give 
live shows so that they can charge a cover to make up for reduced capacity.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"In phase four, students can go back to school.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Well, it's probably summer vacation for most, but some school districts might have summer classes where students 
can get out of the house and catch up on what they missed in spring.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
Summer sports teams might have to get creative.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Football, hockey, and basketball coaches will be inventing and sharing drills that have reduced contact.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Parents might take turns attending games so that they can fill every other bleachers seat to maintain distance.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"There's enough tests that professional sports organizations can pay to have players tested every day to identify cases 
before they can spread meaning.",False,False,good,,,,,,
You can expect to see televised sports again.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"We'll have enough tests for educational institutions to be able to get additional testing support, like maybe my 
cousins college dorm is pretty crowded so they can expect to test more frequently if they want to stay there.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"In phase four, life enters a comfortable new normal for the year before a vaccine, with communities receiving 
up-to-date information on what's safe and the economy coming back into full swing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Things won't be quite the same, we'll be wearing masks in public, moving large events online, and keeping a bit 
more distance than usual.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"But some of our investments will benefit us in the long term, like expanding our public transportation and health 
infrastructure.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Our economy will be pandemic resilient, not just for this pandemic, but ready to hold strong against future attacks.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Throughout these four phases, we're going to see communities being empowered to find creative ways to reopen in 
ways that are safe, legal, and supported with the healthcare infrastructure they need to do testing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Trace those who have been exposed care for this sick and support those who must isolate at home.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So you might be wondering how do we get these resources available for states and local governments to use?,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Basically, we need a pandemic testing board with strong but narrow powers to get the supply chain moving, with 
50 to 500 billion in funding over two years, depending on how effectively we do contact tracing, plus unexpanded health reserves.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"It's a wartime level investment that we are more than capable of, and it costs a lot less than repeatedly shutting down 
the economy in both lives and money.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"We've done our homework on this, so check it out along with the body of supporting work if you're interested.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And people across disciplines and ideologies agree on this plan.,False,False,good,,,,,,
We can do this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
You can do this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Connect with your communities, look for ways to be involved, or create them where you are.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"This is for real, and I've never felt so encouraged and hopeful.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Everyone I've worked with on this project has jumped in to say, what can I do?",False,True,bad,,,,,,
How can I help?,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"People who disagree on everything else and who would ordinarily refuse to be in a room together are working 
together on this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"In ways I would have never, ever expected possible.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"It's kind of miraculous, and I wanted you to know, I wanted you to know it's real, that if you see it on the news with 
some big institutional names attached, claiming all those good stuff about partnership and cooperation, I've been in 
the room with these folks, I mean virtually in the room, but you know, and it's true.",False,False,good,,,,,,
People are working together.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"They are deciding together that we can do this, and we can.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"If you're the hashtagging profile, picturing type, let me tell you hashtag how we reopen.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
We've got icons to see the links below like pandemictesting.org.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Let people know, including your local leaders and elected officials, that they should take a look at this report sooner 
rather than later.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"I mean, we've already got a lot of momentum, but things are moving so fast with this pandemic.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"We could use all the momentum we can get, and I'm pretty sure time isn't obeying the laws of physics right now, 
so yeah, your help would be appreciated.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Okay, that's all for today.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"I send my best to you, and I'm looking forward to seeing the future you help create.",False,False,good,,,,,,
