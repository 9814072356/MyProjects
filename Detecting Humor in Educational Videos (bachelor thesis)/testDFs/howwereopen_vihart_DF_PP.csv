0,so you might see something i ve been working on in the news this week a road map to pandemic resilience,False,False,good,98.0,28.0,0.7777777777777778
1,and this is a four real thing that represents a consensus of people with every political belief and expertise like republicans and democrats and libertarians economists and health officials and ethics and civil liberties folks and at least one mathematician all agreeing,False,False,good,,,
2,so there is a few ways we could respond to this pandemic,False,False,good,,,
3,in the us we already closed down a lot of stuff for a while and it is hard,False,False,good,,,
4,but now it looks like the curve is starting to flatten and we know it is going to keep falling in the near term and all of us want to get back to our lives,False,False,good,,,
5,we do not know exactly what this side of the curve will look like,False,False,good,,,
6,you ve probably seen versions that are optimistically symmetric but unrealistic,False,False,good,,,
7,it ll probably look less like this and more like this which i modeled off of spain,False,True,bad,,,
8,okay so say we reopen soon and whoops that is not ideal,False,True,bad,,,
9,okay say less affected areas can reopen,False,False,good,,,
10,new york is still closed and then some of us at least get a month of freedom and economic activity before we have to reshut down and do it all again,False,False,good,,,
11,and again it would be a reopening roller coaster and it would at least spread out the cases but this plan has a lot of unknowns,False,False,good,,,
12,it would not be back to business as usual when things are open because businesses will not be able to rely on each other to stay open or on their workers to not all fall sick at once,False,False,good,,,
13,anywhere could be the next hotspot,False,False,good,,,
14,it makes it hard to plan and hard to feel safe,False,False,good,,,
15,so here s another way to respond,False,False,good,,,
16,the plan that all these folks agree on is to reopen the economy this summer in four phases so that the curve keeps falling and we can stay open while protecting your health and civil liberties,False,False,good,,,
17,there s three things we need to do this,False,False,good,,,
18,number one is testing,False,False,good,,,
19,we simply need more tests a lot more like millions a day and these tests will be fast,False,False,good,,,
20,no one wants to wait days for their results,False,True,bad,,,
21,number two is tracing,False,False,good,,,
22,contact tracing is how we let you know if there is a chance you have been exposed so you can get a test and find out fast whether you should isolate to stop it from spreading further,False,False,good,,,
23,and number three is supported isolation,False,False,good,,,
24,anyone who tests positive or is waiting for their results needs support isolate at home with health care supplies and job protections,False,False,good,,,
25,so testing tracing supported isolation,False,False,good,,,
26,it s possible but it takes resources,False,False,good,,,
27,so we made our plan as epic as we needed to be to get this done responsibly this summer,False,False,good,,,
28,okay so first is phase one,False,False,good,,,
29,here s where we see the curve flatten and fall by giving our essential workers the support and care they need,False,False,good,,,
30,of the economy is already open,False,False,good,,,

32,they did not ask to be put on the front lines of this crisis but they have stepped up to the challenges,False,False,good,,,
33,so in phase one we grow our resources to support those essential workers and turn our current limited economy into a pandemic resilient foundation,False,False,good,,,
34,we ll hear from our neighbors and friends who work in delivery and law enforcement that thanks to testing and tracing they do not have to wonder anymore if they might be spreading the disease without even knowing it,False,False,good,,,
35,and they do not have to worry about co workers having it without knowing it,False,True,bad,,,
36,when someone tests positive they get sick leave they have other worker protection so no one is worried about getting fired for being sick if they take a test,False,False,good,,,
37,we ll hear from our elders and care facilities that now there is testing in place to make sure there is no chance for this disease to spread out of control,False,False,good,,,
38,that goes for anyone in frequent contact with essential workers including folks in jails and prisons,False,False,good,,,
39,some folks will be going through online training to fill in for essential workers maybe a teacher you know trained to do in home childcare to sub in for someone who is gotten ill and maybe a neighbor who has experienced caring for an elderly relative decides to take the course and is ready to fill in,False,False,good,,,
40,how and where testing gets done might also depend on the community,False,False,good,,,
41,we know that the best way to prevent spread is to find out who was in contact with someone who tests positive so that those people can get tested quickly and have results within hours,False,False,good,,,
42,some communities already have networks of contact tracer that people trust to do this work in a way that protects their rights,False,False,good,,,

45,the better we are at contact tracing the faster we can move on to phase two,False,False,good,,,
46,but worst case we just have to make a lot more tests,False,False,good,,,
47,because in phase one most of us are still isolating at home so we only need to produce enough tests to keep those essential workers safe,False,False,good,,,
48,meanwhile we will hear about all the innovative ways communities and companies are expanding contact tracing and making it work to bring down the number of cases to where we can move to phase two,False,False,good,,,
49,in phase two well we have got our stable foundation of,False,False,good,,,

62,maybe we apply for funding to expand our tiny hospital and there is a demand for construction workers to build it out,False,False,good,,,
63,during this phase which will probably be most of june we can allow a relaxation of certain social distancing measures for those essential workers on the front lines,False,False,good,,,
64,we ll still have to cancel large gatherings but the group of expanded essential workers can safely visit and support each other,False,False,good,,,
65,we ll see restaurants that are currently doing takeout for the general population can be open to serve essential workers on site,False,False,good,,,
