i want to tell you about exotic objects in topology,FALSE,FALSE,good,220,5,0.98,0.98,1,0.99
before i do that let me just tell you more generally what topologists do,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we study geometric shapes but unlike in ordinary geometry we do not care about lengths angles areas volumes,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we do not care about any of that,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we just care about what properties geometric shapes have that are not changed when you deform them,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and by deform i mean you are allowed to bend it and twist it and stretch it as if it is made of an elastic material but you are not allowed to break it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so a square for example if we started manipulating that it would very quickly not be a square anymore,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that s right,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we have a square right here and i could turn it into a circle or more or less a circle by just bending it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and i could also turn it into a triangle,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but what i cannot do is turn let us say a circle into two circles,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the only way to do this would be to break it and then glue it back but that is not allowed,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
similarly i could have a ball and i could turn it into a cube,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there s a saying that topologists are people who cannot tell a part donuts from coffee mugs,TRUE,TRUE,good,,,,,,
so for example here is a donut,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and here is a coffee mug,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i mean they are the same,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they re the same for us because you could deform one into the other,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they both have this hole through them,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but what i cannot do is turn the donut into a ball because the ball does not have a hole,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so i do not want to punch a hole in it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that s not allowed,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and well i could do that by taking a bite out of the donut,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
but with topologist or healthy people were not supposed to be eating donuts,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
the objects that we mostly care about are called manifolds,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
these are objects that look from any given point they look pretty much like flat space or n dimensional hyper space,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
what is n dimensional hyper space,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in dimension one we have a line,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in dimension two we have the plane,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in dimension three we have space,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and then you can think about dimension four just add another variable say time,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and that is four dimensional hyper space,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and you can just add more variables five dimensional and six dimensional and so on,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s not something that we can visualize but we can think of it mathematically anyway,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and we can write down equations,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and manifold in this space,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
or are manifolds in space themselves,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they can sit in the space but they could also look like that space around any point,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so let me tell you an example,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the surface of the earth is a great example,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s a sphere more or less,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s called a geowide,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it has mountains and valleys,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but remember we can all deform them and make it into a sphere,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
topological it is a sphere,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and it sits in three dimensional space,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but around any point it looks like two dimensional plane,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
because i can move basically two directions,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i can move left and right and forwards and backwards,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there are two degrees of freedom,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so that is what i m saying,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that the sphere is a two dimensional manifold even though it lives in three dimensional space,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
ok other examples of two dimensional manifolds would be the surface of the donut,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
or this famous klein bottle,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
yes if i live on it again i would not be able to tell the difference from a plane,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
just like it is pretty hard to tell the difference between a plane and the earth the sphere from where we are,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
to really tell them apart you would have to go far away and see that you come back,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there are also one dimensional manifolds,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
like the circle right here,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s a one dimensional manifold,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if we only lived on the circle then we would only have one direction in which to move in,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and then there are three dimensional manifolds like our ordinary space or the universe,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
around every point it looks like we have three dimensions to go into,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we also have the bottom and top,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but we actually do not know the shape of the universe,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s a three dimensional manifold,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it could be hyperspace but it could be what is called a three dimensional hypersphere,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
perhaps if we go very high up then we would come back to where we are,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
nobody has done that but we do not know if it is possible or not,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
just like on the surface of the earth when you go around you come back,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so we just know it is a three dimensional manifold,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
is there no way to test for that,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s strange that we could not know that even the one we are living in the one we are living and breathing in,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that is the only way to test to walk forever and see if i come back,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
no there are other ways,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
people are looking at the cosmic microwave background radiation,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and they have put forward various theories about what the shape of the universe is,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but there is no definite theory that everyone accepts,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s not yet known what shape it is,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but there are some hints from the universe,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
ok so we have three dimensional objects and then we can think about four dimensionals and so on,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
a good example is this hypersphere,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so in dimension one we have the circle which is a one dimensional manifold and it is the set of points at the given distance from the origin,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s given by the equation x squared plus y squared equals one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
similarly we have this sphere which is again the set of points at distance one from a given point but it lives in three dimensional space and it is given by the equation x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and we can generalize this,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we can talk about the n dimensional hypersphere which is given by the equation x squared plus dot dot dot plus xn squared plus another variable xn plus one squared equals one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it lives in n plus one dimensional space and it is an n dimensional manifold,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
now i m getting to the crux of the matter the exotic objects,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
what are exotic objects,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
these are things that are topologically the same but are smoothly different,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so there are two ways of thinking about the formations in topology,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i showed you before that a circle can be turned into a square and in the process of course you have to make a corner,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
now the circle is smooth and you can turn it into other smooth curves like maybe something like an elix and the process would be smooth,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
now could it be that we have two smooth objects and you can deform one into the other but the only way to do so is by making corners somewhere in the middle,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
then those objects would be topologically the same but smoothly different,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and i do not know if you are more familiar with one of the objects you would say that the second one is an exotic copy of the other one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s like if you live on the first object and you go to the second one it is like going to an exotic location,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
some things are the same but some things are just different,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
now how can this be,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
how can you have two smooth things but to deform one into the other you need to make corners,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
here is an example,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we have a figure eight and can i turn it into a circle,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
well i can do so if i make one of the loops smaller and smaller but at some point i have to make a corner and then it becomes a circle,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
now that is not actually a good example,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
because if i had a third dimension if i allow myself to just lift this up then it would become a circle just smoothly,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so this is not a real example of exotic objects,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in fact i cannot show you exotic objects because they do not exist in dimensions one two and three in the dimensions that we can easily visualize,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they only start existing in dimension four and higher,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the first examples were found in by a mathematician called john melner and they were found in dimension seven,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they are exotic hypersphere of seven dimensions,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so there is some object on exotic sphere that you can deform into the ordinary seven dimensional sphere but not smoothly,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
an exotic sphere is a smooth object that i can deform into a sphere,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but i cannot deform it smoothly,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i would have to make corners in the middle,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
let me show you now the numbers of spheres in each dimension,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in dimension one two three there is just one the standard one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the same goes in dimensions five and six,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
now in dimension seven we actually have spheres,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so there is the standard one and then there are different ones,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
then we have two spheres in dimension eight then eight then six then in dimension eleven we have spheres,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in dimension twelve we have just one then three then two then sixteen thousand then two hundred and fifty six and so on,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if you look at the sequence of numbers it looks strange,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i grant you that but there are some patterns,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
for example in dimensions seven eleven fifteen every four dimensions you get a lot more exotic spheres than in the other nearby dimensions,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
one thing you can ask is in what dimensions do exotics spheres exist,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and in what dimensions does just the standard one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we see that there is just one sphere in dimensions one two three five six twelve and also mathematicians figure it out,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the same is true in dimensions fifty six and sixty one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so does that mean if i was an object living in a sixty one dimensional universe it is a little bit more boring than some of the other ones,TRUE,TRUE,good,,,,,,
that s right yes these are the boring dimensions you do not have exotic spheres,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
although you do have some other exotic objects in these dimensions just not spheres,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
these numbers seem so arbitrary,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i assume it is impossible for someone to easily explain why it is certain numbers that are boring and other ones that are hyper exotic,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
these numbers are hard to compute does a whole story involving bernoulli numbers and homotopic groups of spheres,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the most interesting thing about them is that we can compute them in any dimension except in dimension four,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that s where i left question mark,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that s the biggest mystery,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s one of the most famous open problems in topology,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s called the four dimensional smooth point correct conjecture which says that there are no exotic spheres in dimension four,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but we do not know that for sure yet,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we do not know,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there are examples of objects that are smooth and you can deform them into the ordinary four dimensional sphere by introducing corners,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but people do not know if you can do that smoothly or not,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i have also looked for exotic four dimensional sphere myself and i could not find any,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if you did would you become a very famous mathematician,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
absolutely,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
is it not like a millennium problem,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
is it anything or is it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
no there was a similar conjecture in dimension three the poin correct conjecture,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that was the one problem in topology among my millennium problems that was solved by peralman in,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and i think now the most famous remaining open problem in topology is this one about dimension four,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but it has not yet made it to the list of millennium problems,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
professor do not waste your time making numberphile videos,TRUE,TRUE,good,,,,,,
you need to go upstairs and solve this problem,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
numberphile videos are important too,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
all right,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so why is dimension four so difficult,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
good question,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
well it is more difficult than the lower dimensions,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
one two three becomes in those dimensions we can see things,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and there are also geometric techniques that mathematicians use to study shapes in these dimensions,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
what s interesting is that it is also simpler than dimensions five six and greater,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and the reason for that is a trick about separating disks,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
to explain it let me say one way in which topologists distinguish between shapes,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if i have a lasso and i throw it somewhere on the plane or even on the surface of the earth which is a sphere it would surround a region,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so i could just contract it into a blob around a little point,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but if i have the same lasso and i would put it around the surface around the hole in a donut then i would not be able to contract it without breaking the donut,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and that is one way you can tell the donut apart from the sphere,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so to study these objects mathematicians are looking at loops and how you contract them,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and the contraction spans a disk,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
a disk is a two dimensional object,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and it is easier to study these objects if you can split apart the disks so that you can study each complication one at a time,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
all right how can you split apart disks,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
well let me start with lines,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if i have two lines and they are on the plane and they intersect if i move one a little bit i m not going to be able to take it off the other,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but i can take it off if i allow myself to go into space,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the reason is that three is greater than one plus one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
each line is a one dimensional object and one plus one is two but i have one extra dimension,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and that is why i can do it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
similarly if i m interested in separating disks each disk is a two dimensional object and two plus two is four so i need one extra dimension,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so in dimensions five and higher i can separate disks,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and that just makes topological objects easier to study,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
this is called the whitney trick and it led to the classification of smooth manifolds in higher dimensions back in the s,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and this is the problem with dimension four,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
you can t in dimension four you have not got the space to separate two disks,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that s right,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we do not have the geometric methods from lower dimensions and we do not have the trick about separating disks,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and that makes dimension four the hardest to wrap our heads around,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
to give you an example of something that is unique to dimension four instead of looking at exotic spheres let us look at exotic hyperspaces,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
remember we had the line and then the plane and then the space,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and in end dimensions we have the hyperspace,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so could you have an exotic hyperspace,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
something that looks like a plane or a space and you can deform it into the ordinary one but only by making corners,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
here are the numbers of hyperspaces in each dimension,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in any dimension except four there is just one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there s just a standard one and there are no exotic hyperspaces,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but in dimension four we have infinitely many,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in fact it is more than infinitely many,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s uncountably many,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s not the kind of infinity that you can count one two three and so on,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s as many exotic hyperspaces as there are real numbers,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and this does not happen in any other dimensions,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if you have exotic objects in some other dimensions you know that there are always finitely many of them,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there s finitely many exotic spheres so as i showed you that list of numbers,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but in dimension four you can have infinitely many exotic objects,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and yeah that is what makes dimension four so fascinating,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
does this mean dimension four is something that you should be spending more time on because it is so special,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
or is this a sign that maybe this is a bit of an aberration that you should leave alone,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s a place where you should not play,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that depends on your own perspective,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there are mathematicians who work on the other dimensions,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and there are mathematicians that work on dimension four,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i m in the latter category,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
because quite often when i speak to number theorists and they talk to me about prime numbers and they are showing me some interesting property of prime numbers they very often discard two,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they say we are not going to use two because that is an aberration,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and it ruins everything,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it ruins all our laws and principles on that,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and they just throw it aside,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it sounds like the fourth dimension is your equivalent,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that s pretty much it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in many theorems you say this is happening in all dimensions except four,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and we understand what is happening,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and we just do not know what is happening in dimension four,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but i find that interesting and worthy of study,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
