"This right here is the common hippopotamus, hippopotamus amphibious.",False,False,good,,,
Now for a long time it was assumed that the hippopotamus was related to the pig.,False,False,good,,,
I mean just look at it.,False,True,bad,,,
But recently they figured out that their closest relatives are the cetaceans.,False,False,good,,,
The friggin' whales and dolphins.,True,False,bad,,,
"Not the manatee, now that would have made too much sense.",True,False,bad,,,
"I mean a manatee looks like you made a hippo with build-a-bear, but came up short on stuffing.",True,True,good,,,
Now the manatee is related to the elephant.,False,False,good,,,
While the hippo is a whale that wasn't.,True,True,good,,,
Anyway the ancestors of the hippos didn't join the ancestors of the whales in the ocean.,False,False,good,,,
I have a guess why?,False,True,bad,,,
They didn't know how to swim.,False,False,good,,,
So they stayed in the kitty pool.,True,True,good,,,
And you know what?,False,True,bad,,,
54 million years later they still don't know how to friggin' swim.,True,False,bad,,,
"They really don't, they fake it.",True,True,good,,,
They bounce along the bottom.,False,True,bad,,,
And it's kind of cute.,True,True,good,,,
Look they tuck in their little restangled things like a bunny rabbit.,True,True,good,,,
I mean for not knowing how to swim they're quite graceful.,True,True,good,,,
In part it's because they're sort of a perfect mixture of heavy and buoyant.,False,True,bad,,,
They're heavy because they have these ultra dense bones.,False,False,good,,,
And that's good because without them they'd have some buoyancy stability problems.,False,True,bad,,,
"But with all that fat in those big lungs, they'd roll around like a meat beach ball down there.",True,True,good,,,
But as it is it's almost perfect like they're walking on the moon.,True,False,bad,,,
"But the hippo isn't fully aquatic, it's semi-aquatic, which means it does it half-ass, literally.",True,True,good,,,
Their face took a page from the crocodile and sort of rotated their eyes and nose up to the top.,False,True,bad,,,
And this allows the hippo to hang out in the water looking like a creepy old man in a public pool.,True,True,good,,,
Now being semi-aquatic all this equipment has to work above and below.,False,False,good,,,
And I'll tell you you don't want to play guess that orifice with a hippo.,True,True,good,,,
"Here, look at this one.",False,False,good,,,
You guess and then I'll show you what happens when it opens up.,False,False,good,,,
Oh look it's just an eye.,False,False,good,,,
Under the water they can keep their peepers open because they're protected by a transparent membrane.,False,False,good,,,
Their nostrils look a bit like two hairy mud slugs singing opera.,True,True,good,,,
I know what you're thinking.,False,True,bad,,,
That's a hole you could lose a fist in how they keep the water out.,False,True,bad,,,
Where the trick is when they're relaxed they're closed.,False,True,bad,,,
"This is similar to the dolphins blowhole, which is just a pair of nostrils that joined up and went to the top.",False,True,bad,,,
So every time they want to take a breath they have to flare their nostrils.,False,True,bad,,,
Is it just me here does that look like an evil muppet?,True,True,good,,,
The good thing is it helps keep the water out.,False,True,bad,,,
"Sure once in a while you have to clear out the pipes, but these remarkable nostrils allow the hippo to do something else.",False,True,bad,,,
They can take their nap time under the water.,False,True,bad,,,
Look at that that's how you nap.,False,True,bad,,,
They ever reflex which allows them to raise their head and take breaths all without waking up.,False,False,good,,,
Now their ears do this little thing.,False,True,bad,,,
I like to pretend that they're tiny wings and sometimes it's this little twirly motion.,True,True,good,,,
But this is something they do to get the water out their ears when they come up.,False,True,bad,,,
And you got to keep those clear because there's a lot to listen for.,False,False,good,,,
And it's not just the sounds they make out of the water.,False,False,good,,,
Some of science hippies threw some carrots into murky water and then listened as a science hippo tried to find them.,True,True,good,,,
The hippo made a series of clicks under the water sounded like this.,False,True,bad,,,
I know what you're thinking that's a fart.,True,True,good,,,
They recorded a hippo fart and that would be embarrassing but no I think they ruled that out.,True,True,good,,,
But hippos seem to use clicks to echo locate like the dolphin do and they sound like farts.,False,True,bad,,,
Science.,False,False,good,,,
If the hippo is semi aquatic that means that it is also semi land dick during that summer word.,True,True,good,,,
Now it isn't land dick.,True,True,good,,,
"It's not aqua-dick Jerry it's aquatic but if an hippo spend time on land, it is.",True,True,good,,,
Now you'd think that they'd live in a place that was wet out of the water like Seattle or London.,False,True,bad,,,
But no they live in the hottest shit places and that can be problematic in a couple of ways.,True,True,good,,,
First of all the pools dry out and then what are you?,True,True,good,,,
Semi mud dick.,True,True,good,,,
Jerry I did that for you.,True,True,good,,,
But secondly in the heat they have to keep that giant meat potato from overheating.,True,True,good,,,
They don't have sweat glands but they do look a bit sweaty don't they?,False,True,bad,,,
That's because their skins are creaks amicus.,False,False,good,,,
The amicus has a reddish pigment in it called hypo-sideric acid which turns brown as it dries out.,False,False,good,,,
This compound acts as a sunscreen but also can fight infection from microorganisms and it's another reason why you don't want to ride a hippo naked.,True,True,good,,,
Curiosity stream is pretty amazing.,False,True,bad,,,
I should know because I'm a subscriber and I think you should be one too.,False,True,bad,,,
Listen after all that shorty short form pickles your brain you need to bathe in some nourishing long form content.,False,False,good,,,
You know get your head right again.,False,True,bad,,,
Curiosity stream is packed with thousands of smart and entertaining programs about science.,False,False,good,,,
"History, art, true crime, nature, you know I like nature.",False,True,bad,,,
Look at all that nature but you didn't even know there was that much nature.,False,False,good,,,
I've been enjoying the series Ancient Yellowstone.,False,False,good,,,
It gets into some of the things you missed on that class trip.,False,False,good,,,
"Look at the geyser, look at the geyser.",False,False,good,,,
You know that's all you want do your diet coke and mentos.,False,True,bad,,,
Now this is a deep dive.,False,False,good,,,
There's these crazy ancient microorganisms that live in those lava lamp things.,False,False,good,,,
And there's a big petrified forest up in there.,False,True,bad,,,
Who knew?,False,True,bad,,,
You do?,False,True,bad,,,
Now.,False,True,bad,,,
Curiosity stream has been a long time sponsor of this program.,False,False,good,,,
You know why?,False,True,bad,,,
Because it's great value for great content.,False,False,good,,,
Check it out.,False,True,bad,,,
Go to curiositystream.com slash ZFrank23.,False,True,bad,,,
Because that's how old I am.,False,True,bad,,,
Use code ZFrank23 to get 25% off when you sign up.,False,True,bad,,,
And that makes a great deal even better.,False,False,good,,,
Try it today.,False,True,bad,,,
I'm a fan and happy to have them as a sponsor.,False,True,bad,,,
Where were we?,False,False,good,,,
Oh right.,False,True,bad,,,
"For the most part, hippos eat grasses and shrubbery.",False,True,bad,,,
"Mostly at night, but that footage sucks.",False,True,bad,,,
They sort of use their lips to get at it.,False,True,bad,,,
"All that hardware up front is for fighting, not eating.",False,True,bad,,,
"To chew, they got to take it all the way back to where the little teeth are.",False,False,good,,,
These grasses aren't that nutritious and they're hard to digest.,False,False,good,,,
So bacteria in the hippo's stomach ferment and break down those lawn clippings into something that the hippo can work with.,False,True,bad,,,
"After all that's been taken care of, of course it comes out the other end.",False,True,bad,,,
Spectacularly.,False,False,good,,,
The hippo is not a modest pooper.,True,True,good,,,
Not like a dog sort of looking around guiltily.,True,True,good,,,
It looks like a malfunctioning dodo toilet.,True,True,good,,,
The bedenhozzles on full blast.,True,False,bad,,,
The thought is this is for scent marking because it helps disperse the scent.,False,True,bad,,,
Understatement.,False,True,bad,,,
But here's the thing.,False,False,good,,,
"16 hours a day or so, they're sitting in a pool with a whole bunch of other hippos.",False,True,bad,,,
"You're shifting around a bit, you don't always know what part of the hippo in front of you you're facing.",True,False,bad,,,
"And at some point someone's gonna have to go and it's a pain in the ass to get out, get your flip flops.",True,True,good,,,
Because the floor in the pool house toilet is always wet and you don't know from what.,True,True,good,,,
"So if someone shits in the pool, you could make a big deal out of it.",True,True,good,,,
Or you could lean into it.,True,False,bad,,,
And that's what the hippos did.,False,True,bad,,,
Make some lemonade out of those lemons.,False,True,bad,,,
And by lemonade I mean shits soup.,True,True,good,,,
And by shits soup I mean shits soup with benefits.,True,True,good,,,
Alright that sounds weird.,True,False,bad,,,
"With all the hippos pooping in the pool, that's good news for all the things that like to eat poop.",True,True,good,,,
"But as those creatures thrive, they take oxygen out of the water.",False,False,good,,,
And this in turn makes the water resemble the insides of the hippos' gut.,True,True,good,,,
And that means that those healthy bacteria that are living in the gut can come out and play.,True,False,bad,,,
And suddenly the water's like a big shared gut.,True,False,bad,,,
Everyone's pooping in it and drinking it and officiating it.,True,True,good,,,
I mean it's good bacteria for everyone.,True,False,bad,,,
It's like swimming in kombucha.,True,True,good,,,
Or a compupcha.,True,True,good,,,
Get it?,True,True,good,,,
Kill me.,True,True,good,,,
And this can change entire ecosystems.,False,False,good,,,
The grass is hippozee-er-rich in silica.,False,False,good,,,
The silica gets used by diatoms.,False,False,good,,,
A kind of algae that encases itself in little glass houses.,False,False,good,,,
The diatoms can then out-compete green algae.,False,False,good,,,
Which is good because green algae blooms can choke out all the sunlight in the body of water.,False,False,good,,,
You want a nice healthy lake?,False,True,bad,,,
Have a hippo shit in it.,True,True,good,,,
Who knew?,False,True,bad,,,
But don't start thinking that hippos are just a group of mellow environmentalist river pooping hippies.,True,True,good,,,
"They've got some spunk to- we don't use that word, Jerry.",True,True,good,,,
They've got some attitude.,False,True,bad,,,
I mean look at this one.,False,True,bad,,,
It's chasing a freaking boat.,False,True,bad,,,
They can gallop underwater.,False,True,bad,,,
And look it's got a bigger wake than the boat.,False,False,good,,,
I mean they're not bad on land either.,False,False,good,,,
Those dense bones they have can support all that weight even in a sprint.,False,False,good,,,
And in short stretches they can go 30 miles an hour.,False,True,bad,,,
I mean look at that thing.,False,True,bad,,,
Coming at you and that's a guaranteed pant load.,True,True,good,,,
Now being a mucus covered giant bulldozer gives you some protection.,True,True,good,,,
But they also have a weaponized face.,False,True,bad,,,
You know when somebody yawns and then like you have to yawn?,False,True,bad,,,
Imagine what it's like for the hippos because their yawn goes on for days.,True,True,good,,,
This mouth wide open gesture exposes their canine teeth which can be over two feet long.,False,False,good,,,
They never stop growing and they self-sharpen by rubbing against each other.,False,True,bad,,,
When you put all that together and you have a creature that really doesn't give a fuck. Look at this one.,True,True,good,,,
You know what he's doing?,False,True,bad,,,
Wait for it.,False,True,bad,,,
He's fucking with a rhino.,True,True,good,,,
And the rhino doesn't know what the hell's going on.,True,True,good,,,
He's like you sure about this bro.,True,True,good,,,
And the hippo keeps at it until it does what you're not supposed to do.,False,True,bad,,,
Which is turn your backside to a pissed off rhino.,True,True,good,,,
Look at that.,False,False,good,,,
Right in the noodle.,False,True,bad,,,
However most of the hippos profound tothidity is reserved for other hippos.,False,False,good,,,
A single alpha male has the exclusive right to mate with all the females in the pod.,False,False,good,,,
Younger horny males hang out on the periphery and take out their sexual frustration on each other.,True,True,good,,,
Now if you're having trouble figuring out who's who you're not alone.,False,False,good,,,
It turns out it's not that easy to tell the hippopotamuses from the hippopotamisters.,True,True,good,,,
Come on that's amazing.,False,False,good,,,
Well in this shot you can probably tell.,False,True,bad,,,
And this is essentially what hippopornography looks like.,True,True,good,,,
It's why you don't see very much of it on your websites.,False,True,bad,,,
I mean you might get a shot of a nostril here there but it's sort of boring.,False,True,bad,,,
But I suppose don't judge until you've had a hippopotamus on top of yours.,True,True,good,,,
It's so bad.,False,True,bad,,,
Anyway that's how they do it and you know what happens next.,False,True,bad,,,
This right here is a mummy hippo in the process of giving birth to a brand new baby.,False,True,bad,,,
Birth usually happens under the water and the baby needs to learn quick how to come up for air.,False,False,good,,,
It's not all that strong yet and it's still learning to hold its breath.,False,False,good,,,
So for the time being mummy helps out with the nudge before it sinks back down like a flesh rock.,False,True,bad,,,
Soon enough though it gets the hang of it.,False,True,bad,,,
For the first months the mummy hippo will raise the baby away from the pod for reasons that will be painfully obvious.,False,True,bad,,,
But for now this is about as sweet as a hippo relationship gets.,False,True,bad,,,
I mean come on those babies are cute.,False,True,bad,,,
And look at pygmy hippo babies.,False,True,bad,,,
I mean that's off the charts.,False,True,bad,,,
It's like a gummy bear come to life.,True,True,good,,,
But parenting out there isn't all that easy.,False,False,good,,,
No behind that that's a crocodile hot.,True,True,good,,,
Hot.,True,False,bad,,,
Oh for god's sakes.,True,True,good,,,
At this size the babies are still vulnerable to predators that wouldn't take on a full grown hippo.,False,True,bad,,,
So it's helpful to have a full grown hippo around.,False,True,bad,,,
Look at the animal watching the whole thing.,False,True,bad,,,
Like wildlife rubber necking.,False,True,bad,,,
It's like suck it leopard.,True,True,good,,,
Yeah suck oh shit they're leaving.,True,True,good,,,
It's a bit of an incredible adventure out there alone with your mother learning how best to hip a bottom.,False,True,bad,,,
And after surviving leopards and lions and crocodiles it's time for them to go back and re-enter the pod.,False,True,bad,,,
Which is perhaps more dangerous than all of what they've been through.,False,False,good,,,
Now let's just say that our little friend made it back just fine.,False,False,good,,,
But to understand the hippopotamus you should know that many don't.,False,True,bad,,,
If a new male is taken over the pod it will often kill returning pups.,False,False,good,,,
It's a sad thing but a true thing.,False,False,good,,,
And that's the thing with these hippos.,False,True,bad,,,
They alternate between this sort of serene calm and sudden moments of extreme violence.,False,True,bad,,,
But that sort of unpredictability might be the best way to stay alive.,False,False,good,,,
And they have stayed alive.,False,False,good,,,
Big buckets of flesh among lions and leopards.,False,True,bad,,,
And that is just how the hippo do.,False,True,bad,,,
No Jerry they're not using farts to echolocate.,True,True,good,,,
How do I know?,False,False,good,,,
For one what are they going to do?,False,False,good,,,
Have a bean burrito three hours before they want to find a carrot?,True,True,good,,,
They can't just fart on command Jerry.,True,True,good,,,
And anyway they know it wasn't a fart.,False,True,bad,,,
Well I don't know.,False,True,bad,,,
They look for bubbles Jerry.,False,True,bad,,,
Do your magic sonar farts not make bubbles?,True,True,good,,,
No.,True,True,good,,,
No you cannot use my bathtub.,True,True,good,,,
Idiot.,True,True,good,,,
