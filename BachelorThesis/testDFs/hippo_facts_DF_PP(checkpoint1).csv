210,and after surviving leopards and lions and crocodiles it is time for them to go back and re enter the pod,False,False,good,,,,,,
211,which is perhaps more dangerous than all of what they have been through,False,False,good,,,,,,

214,if a new male is taken over the pod it will often kill returning pups,False,False,good,,,,,,
215,it s a sad thing but a true thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
216,and that is the thing with these hippos,False,False,good,,,,,,
217,they alternate between this sort of serene calm and sudden moments of extreme violence,False,False,good,,,,,,

219,and they have stayed alive,False,False,good,,,,,,
