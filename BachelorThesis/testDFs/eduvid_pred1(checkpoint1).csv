Hello and welcome to another coding challenge.,False,False,good,248.0,54.0,0.8211920529801324,0.625,0.08928571428571429,0.15625
"Well, I'm excited about this one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"In this coding challenge, I'm going to attempt to make this fern.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"The barnsley fern, named for the British mathematician Michael Barnsley.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"I encourage you to read this Wikipedia page, which will give you more background on it.",False,False,good,,,,,,
What I'm going to do is just look at the algorithm and try to write that algorithm into code and see if we can get that result.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then you, the creative viewer of this coding challenge, will make your own version with different colors.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And you'll think about animating it and do all sorts of things that I couldn't possibly even imagine.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"So, for what is the algorithm here?",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, if we look down here, I'm just going to skip down down here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"It says, the first point is drawn at the origin x equals 0, y equals 0.",False,False,good,,,,,,
So what this means is where you need some sort of two-dimensional space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"It could be a processing canvas and I want to start at 0, 0.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Now, I'm going to think of 0, 0 in the center here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And I'm going to have to probably figure out some ways of, well, the pixels are here, but then 0, 0 on the pixel spaces here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
But I'm not going to worry about that right now.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then, what's the next step?",False,False,good,,,,,,
"The next step is, and then the new points are iteratively computed by randomly applying one of the four following coordinate transformations.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And here they are to find out this is the kind of stuff that you might see and think: ""AHH! OK, I'm going to go do something else.""",True,True,good,,,,,,
This looks like matrix math and linear algebra.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"But this is actually, first of all, if you watch some of my matrix videos, this is going to strangely enough make sense to you.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
But let me actually show you that this math is actually quite simple.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Let's use just this second one and let's rewrite this over on the board.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, f of 2x, y equals, so I'm going to have to go back and check it, haha.",True,True,good,,,,,,
"0.85, 0.04, 0.85, 0.04.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Negative 0.04, negative 0.04, I should have made up my own numbers, haha.",True,True,good,,,,,,
"0.85, 0.85.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Then we have x, y. Oh no, I'm running out of space.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
I'm running out of space.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Plus, I can put this in.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
You can see that 0 and 1.6.,False,False,good,,,,,,
What does this mean?,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Well, this is actually the matrix product or the matrix multiplication or the dot product.",False,False,good,,,,,,
What it means is I want to find the values.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"If this is x1, y1, what I want to get is the next values for x.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, I have one point and I want to know where does that point go?",False,False,good,,,,,,
"What's x2, y2?",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, this being x2 equals this number times that 0.85, sorry, times x1 plus this number times that the row gets multiplied by the column, 0.04 times y1.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And then plus this number plus 0.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then y2 then equals negative 0.04 times x1 plus 0.85, and my handwriting's terrible, times y1, this column times this column plus 1.6.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"So, it's really just this formula.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"If I have an xy coordinate, I get the next xy coordinate with this math.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And we can just double check that this is right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Look at that for a second with my horrible messy handwriting.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"And then let's go down here and see, look at this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
It's the same thing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"x, the next x is this number times the previous x plus this number times the previous y.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And the next y is this number times the previous x plus this number times the previous y plus 1.6.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, we just need to do one of these four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And each one of those four we do according to a particular probability.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Right?,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Oh right, ABCDE.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Yep, that could have written it this way.",False,False,good,,,,,,
That's the generic way of writing.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Okay, so, all right, so let's go back into that, let's start writing some code.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"All right, so I have a processing sketch, a Java-based programming environment with a nice API for drawing stuff and lots more processing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
I'm going to say background equals zero.,False,False,good,,,,,,
I'm going to have an x ​​and a y. I'm going to set those to be zero to start.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"I'm going to draw, I'm going to say stroke.",False,False,good,,,,,,
255,False,False,good,,,,,,
Stroke weight.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Sorry, stroke, stroke weight eight.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
And then I'm going to draw a point at x point y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
OK?,True,False,bad,,,,,,
And then what I need to do is get the next value.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, next x equals some number, a times x plus b times y plus c. And actually, so let's just use these numbers here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Let's just copy these.,False,False,good,,,,,,
0.85.04.,False,False,good,,,,,,
0.85,False,False,good,,,,,,
Negative 0.04.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Negative 0.04.0.85.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And next y is negative 0.04.0.05.,False,False,good,,,,,,
0.05,False,False,good,,,,,,
0.05.0.25.,False,False,good,,,,,,
0.05.0.25.,False,False,good,,,,,,
0.05.0.25.,False,False,good,,,,,,
0.05.0.25.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"No, what's going on?",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"OK, everything's fine now.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Breathe, everybody.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
Breathe would be.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Okay, so this is applying that particular transformation.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And then I could just say x equals next x. Y equals next y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, what if I were to do this and run this?",False,False,good,,,,,,
I don't get any errors.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, I do see this circle over here being drawn.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, here's the thing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
I'm only applying one of those transformations.,False,False,good,,,,,,
I need to pick one of four.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And I also am not thinking sort of thoughtfully about the pixel space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, I need to do a mapping, right?",False,False,good,,,,,,
"x with pixels goes from 0 to 600, 0 to 600.",False,False,good,,,,,,
But maybe I want to think of this as a space between negative 1 and 1 and negative 1 and 1.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, what I want to do is say, when I actually go to draw it, pixel x equals map x, which goes between negative 1 and 1 to 0 and width, and pixel y between negative 1 and 1.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And I'm going to flip the axis, height, 0.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then I'm going to draw the point at px, py.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Let's run this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then, oh, okay, and then I only want to draw the background once.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And we can see, there we go.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, if I apply that transformation over and over again, we can see the point going up that way.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Now, is that right?",False,False,good,,,,,,
That looked weird to me.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
This has to be y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Yes, this needs to be y. I was like mapping the x value.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"I was like, why is it, uh, alright.",True,True,good,,,,,,
"So, uh, mmm, alright.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"It's not moving very much, but that's fine.",False,False,good,,,,,,
I'm just applying this one transformation.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Alright, let's look at the values.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Just to sort of see what those values ​​are doing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And we can see, there we go.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Now, it kind of settled.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Interestingly enough, it settled to a fixed point.",False,False,good,,,,,,
hmm,False,False,good,,,,,,
But here's the thing.,False,False,good,,,,,,
We need to do one of four transformations.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, I need to do the tedious thing.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Now, I could probably write the encode these into arrays and, like, automatically.",False,False,good,,,,,,
But I'm going to do this in a very long-winded way.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
Just to see the code.,False,False,good,,,,,,
I'm going to have four of these possibilities.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, this is actually number two.",False,False,good,,,,,,
I need to have one.,False,False,good,,,,,,
I need to have three.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And I need to have four.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And I probably should put these in a function.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"But, oh, there's so many ways I could organize the code to be better.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
But I'm going to just do it this way right now.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"And I'm going to, maybe I'll refactor it all later, let you do that.",True,True,good,,,,,,
"So, let's go back and look at the algorithm.",False,False,good,,,,,,
This is just zero and point one six times y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So, this one is actually just zero.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And this is actually just zero point one, zero point one six times y.",False,False,good,,,,,,
That's option number one.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Option number two, we did.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Option number three.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Option number three is point two, negative point two six, point two, negative zero point two six.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then point two three, point two two, one point six.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Point two three, point two two, two point six, what that what it was?",False,False,good,,,,,,
One point six.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then, option number four is negative point one five, point two eight.",False,False,good,,,,,,
You're really watching me do this.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
Negative one five and two eight.,False,False,good,,,,,,
That's not right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Yeah, it's right.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"And then, two six two four four four.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Two six two four four four four.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Let's auto format all this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Okay, now, this is the really important part.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
I need everything to line up.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
It's not lining up the way I wanted to.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
Help me line up.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"No, no, this plus has to go here.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
This has to go there.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
That's ok now.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
This is ok.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
That's fine.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
That's fine.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"OK, it's fine now.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
Everything's okay everybody.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Oh wait, no, no, no.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
I need a zero here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Definitely need a zero there.,False,False,good,,,,,,
OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
What's wrong?,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Oh, no, no.",False,False,good,,,,,,
These have to go over because there's no negative there.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Oh, and this has, yeah, I don't like this.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
This has to go over too.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Yes, yes.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"OK, this has to go over.",False,False,good,,,,,,
There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"OK, that's much better now.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Now, the other thing is, I'm just going to say float next x.",True,False,bad,,,,,,
Float next y.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then, I'm going to, because I just wanted to clear the variables once.",False,False,good,,,,,,
I'm going to get rid of all of these.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Yes, you're watching me do this in the most tedious, ridiculous way possible.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"But it's good, this is good for you.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Because you're in your frustration and like, oh, I got a lot.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"You're going to, you're going to improve your coding skills by doing it in a different way.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Watching me and my poor, poor, poor way of doing this.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
OK.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
So this is good.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Now, I need to, now I'm going to pick a random number.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And I'm just going to say, I'm going to just do this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"If r is less, I'm going to, I'm going to do a one out of four chance for each of these.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"If r is less than 0.25, do this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Otherwise, if r is less than 0.5, do this one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Otherwise, otherwise, if r is less than 0.75, do this one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then otherwise, do the last one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So now, I'm just doing a one out of four chance of doing any of these.",False,False,good,,,,,,
OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So let's, all right.",False,False,good,,,,,,
So let's run this and see what happens.,False,False,good,,,,,,
We're not going to get the fern.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"But we should get, ooh, look at this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
I'm getting something.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"It's just, look at this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Oh, it might even be like two.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"It's just, look at this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Oh, it might even be like, tree like.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So one thing I want to do is, I want to pick the, I want to take this, which is like, sort of like next point.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And I'm going to put that into its own function, next point.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So that I can, because I'm, I'm probably going to want to also do this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Oh, and then I'm going to take this and draw a point.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then, because I might want to do these multiple times in draw.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So I think just, and I could probably do this in an object oriented way.",False,False,good,,,,,,
I should probably store it in a ray of all the points.,False,False,good,,,,,,
But let's just look at this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So now, let's, let me let this go a little faster.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Let me say, do a hundred of these transformations per frame.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"And we can see, and by the way, 0, 0 should be at the bottom.",False,False,good,,,,,,
I am now sort of figuring out.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So I'm going to put 0, 0 at the bottom.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So I'm going to map this from a two, two down to 0.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Right?,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Oh whoa, I did that.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"No, 0 to 2, I mean.",False,False,good,,,,,,
0 to 2,False,False,good,,,,,,
There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So here's my weird tree thing that I'm making without being thoughtful about those probabilities.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
Let's go look at the Wikipedia page for those probabilities.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And you can see they're actually right here in this table.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So this table is actually defining all those coefficients.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And here in repeat probability.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So we have a 1% chance of the first one, 85% chance of the second, 7% chance of the third, and 7% chance of the fourth.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So I'm actually going to put this, I'm going to amazingly do this in an array.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Well, actually, so, so, okay.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
"So there is, let's think about this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
Back here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
There's a 1% chance of this first one.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So I know that should be this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Now, I want to have an 85% chance of this second one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So now I actually need to look and see, is it less than 0.86?",False,False,good,,,,,,
"Because if it's less than 0.01, that's a 1% chance.",False,False,good,,,,,,
And between 0.01 and 0.86 is 85%.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Then I need to do less than 0.93, right?",False,False,good,,,,,,
Because there's a 7% chance of this third one.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And in all other cases, the fourth one.",False,False,good,,,,,,
So let's look at this now.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And are we going to get a barnsley firm?,False,False,good,,,,,,
This is looking pretty good.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"Now, everything's like way off the screen, right?",False,True,bad,,,,,,
Because I wasn't proud.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
"I was like, oh, that'll just make up between negative 1 and 1.",False,False,good,,,,,,
"But you might have noticed, remember the jazz timing?",False,False,good,,,,,,
Plus 1.6.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"So clearly, the point can go further than that.",False,False,good,,,,,,
So let's give ourselves some more space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So where are the mappings?,False,False,good,,,,,,
The mappings are here.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Let's go from 0 to 4.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And let's try negative 2 to 2.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And let's make the stroke weight a little bit less.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Let's give ourselves much more space.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Oh, look at that.",False,True,bad,,,,,,
Beauty-us-ness.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
Barnsley firm.,False,False,good,,,,,,
That looks about right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So I'm done.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Even though I want to do so much more.,False,False,good,,,,,,
But I'm not going to.,False,False,good,,,,,,
I'm going to let you do more.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Because what can you, how could you animate this?",False,False,good,,,,,,
How could you pick color?,False,False,good,,,,,,
How could you consider the space?,False,False,good,,,,,,
How could you connect the points?,False,False,good,,,,,,
How could you render this in a different way?,False,False,good,,,,,,
There's so many possibilities.,False,False,good,,,,,,
But I'm going to leave this at this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
I've just done the core algorithm.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And we have this barnsley firm.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And you know, you can, by the way, you can draw.",False,False,good,,,,,,
You can see here's variations of this.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"Why is mine kind of different than this, though?",False,False,good,,,,,,
"So first of all, I'm discovering here.",False,False,good,,,,,,
This is actually giving me the correct range.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So let's actually do this range.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Let's go into the code and implement the range that was on the Wikipedia page.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So negative.,False,False,good,,,,,,
To there.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And then zero to, let's try this.",False,False,good,,,,,,
There we go.,False,False,good,,,,,,
OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So I wasn't mapping the proper range.,False,False,good,,,,,,
So it didn't curve to the right.,False,False,good,,,,,,
But now I am mapping the full barnsley firm.,False,True,bad,,,,,,
Thank you very much.,False,False,good,,,,,,
I really want to make it rainbow color and do other stuff.,False,False,good,,,,,,
But we have completed it.,False,False,good,,,,,,
This is the barnsley firm fractal in processing in about three hours and 42 minutes.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Thanks for watching this entire video.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And I hope you make a variation of this in some way that I couldn't possibly imagine.,False,False,good,,,,,,
And share it with me.,False,False,good,,,,,,
Share it in the comments.,False,False,good,,,,,,
There's a way you can go to the coding train.com and submit a link to your contribution.,False,False,good,,,,,,
"And on Twitter, at shift minarets, the coding train.",False,False,good,,,,,,
OK.,False,False,good,,,,,,
thanks,False,False,good,,,,,,
And I will see you all in the next coding challenge.,False,False,good,,,,,,
