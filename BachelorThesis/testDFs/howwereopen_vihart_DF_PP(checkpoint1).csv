so you might see something i ve been working on in the news this week a road map to pandemic resilience,FALSE,FALSE,good,118,8,0.94,1,0.94,0.97
and this is a four real thing that represents a consensus of people with every political belief and expertise like republicans and democrats and libertarians economists and health officials and ethics and civil liberties folks and at least one mathematician all agreeing,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so there is a few ways we could respond to this pandemic,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in the us we already closed down a lot of stuff for a while and it is hard,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but now it looks like the curve is starting to flatten and we know it is going to keep falling in the near term and all of us want to get back to our lives,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we do not know exactly what this side of the curve will look like,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
you ve probably seen versions that are optimistically symmetric but unrealistic,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it ll probably look less like this and more like this which i modeled off of spain,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
okay so say we reopen soon and whoops that is not ideal,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
okay say less affected areas can reopen,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
new york is still closed and then some of us at least get a month of freedom and economic activity before we have to reshut down and do it all again,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and again it would be a reopening roller coaster and it would at least spread out the cases but this plan has a lot of unknowns,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it would not be back to business as usual when things are open because businesses will not be able to rely on each other to stay open or on their workers to not all fall sick at once,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
anywhere could be the next hotspot,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it makes it hard to plan and hard to feel safe,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so here s another way to respond,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the plan that all these folks agree on is to reopen the economy this summer in four phases so that the curve keeps falling and we can stay open while protecting your health and civil liberties,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there s three things we need to do this,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
number one is testing,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we simply need more tests a lot more like millions a day and these tests will be fast,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
no one wants to wait days for their results,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
number two is tracing,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
contact tracing is how we let you know if there is a chance you have been exposed so you can get a test and find out fast whether you should isolate to stop it from spreading further,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and number three is supported isolation,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
anyone who tests positive or is waiting for their results needs support isolate at home with health care supplies and job protections,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so testing tracing supported isolation,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s possible but it takes resources,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so we made our plan as epic as we needed to be to get this done responsibly this summer,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
okay so first is phase one,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
here s where we see the curve flatten and fall by giving our essential workers the support and care they need,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
of the economy is already open,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
thanks to essential workers like nurses grocery store workers utilities maintenance workers police and firefighters restaurant and delivery workers,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they did not ask to be put on the front lines of this crisis but they have stepped up to the challenges,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so in phase one we grow our resources to support those essential workers and turn our current limited economy into a pandemic resilient foundation,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we ll hear from our neighbors and friends who work in delivery and law enforcement that thanks to testing and tracing they do not have to wonder anymore if they might be spreading the disease without even knowing it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and they do not have to worry about co workers having it without knowing it,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
when someone tests positive they get sick leave they have other worker protection so no one is worried about getting fired for being sick if they take a test,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we ll hear from our elders and care facilities that now there is testing in place to make sure there is no chance for this disease to spread out of control,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
that goes for anyone in frequent contact with essential workers including folks in jails and prisons,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
some folks will be going through online training to fill in for essential workers maybe a teacher you know trained to do in home childcare to sub in for someone who is gotten ill and maybe a neighbor who has experienced caring for an elderly relative decides to take the course and is ready to fill in,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
how and where testing gets done might also depend on the community,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we know that the best way to prevent spread is to find out who was in contact with someone who tests positive so that those people can get tested quickly and have results within hours,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
some communities already have networks of contact tracer that people trust to do this work in a way that protects their rights,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
while in some communities we might hear about people working together to build these networks,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
maybe some will use technology to help,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the better we are at contact tracing the faster we can move on to phase two,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but worst case we just have to make a lot more tests,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
because in phase one most of us are still isolating at home so we only need to produce enough tests to keep those essential workers safe,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
meanwhile we will hear about all the innovative ways communities and companies are expanding contact tracing and making it work to bring down the number of cases to where we can move to phase two,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in phase two well we have got our stable foundation of,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so now we expand essential workers to,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
communities will be empowered to put programs in place to train and hire more people in essential jobs lightening the burden on the current essential workforce,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we ll be able to address supply chain problems,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
you can find toilet paper in stores and order pasta online again,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
we might see one city get more buses on the street and hire more folks to drive those buses so that expanded essential workers can get to their jobs safely without being in a crowded environment,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
another city without buses to spare might invest in hiring a set of workers to build out more public transit infrastructure,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
more people will get hired to serve in roles in unemployment and retraining so more people can access support,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
a doctor who is tested positive and has to isolate might teach courses on how to do a swab test,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
a contact tracer with years experience might partner with their county to start an online training program for contact tracers,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
maybe the bay area leans heavily on appassisted contact tracing,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
maybe la partners with an organization like unidos us to work with immigrants on community run contact tracing they trust,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in a rural county like mine maybe we do most of our contact tracing the old fashioned way over the phone with one of our local figures that everyone already knows anyway and we can take a test at the old elementary school if we need to,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
maybe we apply for funding to expand our tiny hospital and there is a demand for construction workers to build it out,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
during this phase which will probably be most of june we can allow a relaxation of certain social distancing measures for those essential workers on the front lines,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we ll still have to cancel large gatherings but the group of expanded essential workers can safely visit and support each other,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we ll see restaurants that are currently doing takeout for the general population can be open to serve essential workers on site,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if there is any question of exposure there is enough tests to find out and the health resources to respond as necessary,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we ll see our friends and relatives in essential sectors go from stress and scared to secure and supported,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
before long of the population is part of a smoothly working pandemic resilient economy and so we move on to phase three,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
phase three is short and sweet,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it gets our workforce back to though some of us will still be working from home,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it lasts just a week or two and by the end there will be no corona induced unemployment,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
phase three is where non essential businesses like hair and nail salons work that cannot be done remotely will restart with safety precautions like public mask wearing,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
maybe a friend reopens his hair salon giving priority to essential workers in his community like doctors and bus drivers,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
he knows they are able to get testing if there is a chance they have been exposed so that if any of his clients do test positive he will be informed by a contact tracer that he should get tested too in case,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
he makes sure to only have one client in his shop at a time and take special precautions to clean down surfaces between clients,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
office workers and mathematicians like me will still be working from home in phase three and asked not to go out for just this next week or two but now i can get a home visit from a hair colorist or a massage therapist,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i ll leave the on location visits for the workers who do not have the at home job security i have just until we have ramped up our supplies to where we can move on to phase four,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
phase three also increases support for the unemployed homeless and underhoused,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
this phase is probably early july so i ll be looking to my county for guidance on whether it is safe to have a small fourth of july gathering maybe keeping our distance outside on the porch or following other recommendations,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
and then at the end of july we enter phase four,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the last of workers still working from home can start going to the office again,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
you might start going in just a few days a week after taking a test covered by insurance and then working from home for the rest of the week while a different group of workers has in office days,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
some industries might face things differently and different offices will make different decisions based on guidance and resources,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we can plan for summer barbecues with our family and friends because we will have clear guidance about safety and access to tests,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we can go to parks and go shopping wearing a mask without fear that coronavirus is lying in weight on every surface,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
a restaurant owner in new york where tables are usually spaced close together might have to reduce capacity but they are happy to have office workers able to dine out again,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in my town maybe most restaurants have enough space that folks can keep a safe distance at about the usual capacity,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
maybe our local club replaces the dance floor with safely spaced bar tables and they hire local performers to give live shows so that they can charge a cover to make up for reduced capacity,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in phase four students can go back to school,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
well it is probably summer vacation for most but some school districts might have summer classes where students can get out of the house and catch up on what they missed in spring,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
summer sports teams might have to get creative,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
football hockey and basketball coaches will be inventing and sharing drills that have reduced contact,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
parents might take turns attending games so that they can fill every other bleachers seat to maintain distance,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there s enough tests that professional sports organizations can pay to have players tested every day to identify cases before they can spread meaning,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
you can expect to see televised sports again,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we ll have enough tests for educational institutions to be able to get additional testing support like maybe my cousins college dorm is pretty crowded so they can expect to test more frequently if they want to stay there,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in phase four life enters a comfortable new normal for the year before a vaccine with communities receiving up to date information on what is safe and the economy coming back into full swing,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
things will not be quite the same we will be wearing masks in public moving large events online and keeping a bit more distance than usual,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but some of our investments will benefit us in the long term like expanding our public transportation and health infrastructure,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
our economy will be pandemic resilient not just for this pandemic but ready to hold strong against future attacks,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
throughout these four phases we are going to see communities being empowered to find creative ways to reopen in ways that are safe legal and supported with the healthcare infrastructure they need to do testing,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
trace those who have been exposed care for this sick and support those who must isolate at home,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so you might be wondering how do we get these resources available for states and local governments to use,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
basically we need a pandemic testing board with strong but narrow powers to get the supply chain moving with to billion in funding over two years depending on how effectively we do contact tracing plus unexpanded health reserves,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s a wartime level investment that we are more than capable of and it costs a lot less than repeatedly shutting down the economy in both lives and money,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we ve done our homework on this so check it out along with the body of supporting work if you are interested,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and people across disciplines and ideologies agree on this plan,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we can do this,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
you can do this,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
connect with your communities look for ways to be involved or create them where you are,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
this is for real and i ve never felt so encouraged and hopeful,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
everyone i ve worked with on this project has jumped in to say what can i do,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
how can i help,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
people who disagree on everything else and who would ordinarily refuse to be in a room together are working together on this,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in ways i would have never ever expected possible,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s kind of miraculous and i wanted you to know i wanted you to know it is real that if you see it on the news with some big institutional names attached claiming all those good stuff about partnership and cooperation i ve been in the room with these folks i mean virtually in the room but you know and it is true,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
people are working together,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they are deciding together that we can do this and we can,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if you are the hashtagging profile picturing type let me tell you hashtag how we reopen,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we ve got icons to see the links below like pandemictesting org,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
let people know including your local leaders and elected officials that they should take a look at this report sooner rather than later,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i mean we have already got a lot of momentum but things are moving so fast with this pandemic,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we could use all the momentum we can get and i m pretty sure time is not obeying the laws of physics right now so yeah your help would be appreciated,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
okay that is all for today,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
i send my best to you and i m looking forward to seeing the future you help create,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
