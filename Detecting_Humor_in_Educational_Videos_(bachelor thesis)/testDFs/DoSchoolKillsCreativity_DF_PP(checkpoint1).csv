how are you,FALSE,FALSE,good,119,34,0.79,0.78,0.98,0.87
it s been great is not it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s been blown away by the whole thing,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in fact i m leaving,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
there were three themes running through the conference and i m going to talk about one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we have had and in all the people here,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
just the variety of it and the range of it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
the second is that it is put us in a place where we have no idea what is going to happen in terms of the future,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
no idea how this may play out,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i have an interest in education,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
actually what i find is everybody has an interest in education,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i find this very interesting,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if you do that at a dinner party and you say you work in education actually you are not often at dinner parties frankly if you work in education you are not asked and you will never ask back curiously,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
but if you are and you say to somebody what do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face they re like oh my god why me my one night out all week,TRUE,TRUE,good,,,,,,
but if you ask their education they pin you to the wall because it is one of those things that goes deep with people am i right religion and money,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i have a big interest in education i think we all do,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we have a huge vested interest in it partly because it is education that is meant to take us into this future that we cannot grasp if you think of it children starting school this year will be retiring in nobody has a clue,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
despite all the expertise that is been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years time and yet we are meant to be educating them for it so the unpredictability i think is extraordinary,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and the third part of this is that we have all agreed nonetheless on the really extraordinary capacities that children have their capacities for innovation,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i mean serena last night was a marvel wasn t she just seeing what you could do and she is exceptional but i think she is not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and my contention is all kids have tremendous talents and we squander them pretty ruthlessly,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so i want to talk about education and i want to talk about creativity my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
thank you that was it thank you very much,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
so minutes left,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
well i was born,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
no the,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
i had a great story recently,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i love telling it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i have a little girl who was in a drawing lesson she was six and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did and the teacher was fascinated she went over to and she said what are you drawing and the girl said i m drawing a picture of god and the teacher said but nobody knows what god looks like and the girl said they will in a minute,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
okay,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
when,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
when my son was four in england actually he was four everywhere to be honest i mean for being strict about it wherever he went he was four out here,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
but he was in the nativity play,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
do you remember the story,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
no it was big,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it was big story,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
mel gibson at the sequel you may have seen it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
nativity too,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
james got the part of joseph which we were thrilled about we consider this to be one of the lead parts,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we had the place crammed full of agents in t shirts,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
james robinson is joseph,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
he did not have to speak,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but you know where the three kings come in they come in bearing gifts and they bring gold frankincense and meh,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
this really happened,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we re sitting there,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and they,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i think just went out of sequence,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
because we talked to little boy afterwards and said you know you are okay with that,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and they said yeah why was that wrong,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they just switched,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i think it was it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
anyway the three boys came in little four year olds with two towns on their heads and they put these boxes down i bring you gold and the second boy said i bring you mayor and the third boy said frank sent this,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
well these things having in common is that kids will take a chance you know if they do not know they will have a go am i right,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they re not frightened of being wrong now i do not mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative what we do know is if you are not prepared to be wrong you will never come up with anything original if you are not prepared to be wrong,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity they have become frightened of being wrong,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and we run our companies this by the way,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we stigmatize mistakes,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and we are now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
picasso once said this he said that all children are born artists the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
i believe this passionately that we do not grow into creativity we grow out of it or rather we get educated out of it so why is this,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
i lived in stratford on avon until about five years ago we moved from stratford to los angeles so you can imagine what a seamless transition you know this was from,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
actually we lived in a place called sinisterfield just outside stratford which is where shakespeare s father was born,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
are you struck by a new thought i was,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
you do not think of shakespeare having a father do you do you,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
because you do not think of shakespeare being a child shakespeare being seven i never thought of it i mean he was a seven at some point he was in somebody s english class was not he,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
being sent to bed by his dad to shakespeare go to bed now to william shakespeare and put the pencil down and stop speaking like that it s confusing everybody,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
anyway we moved from stratford to los angeles and i just want to say a word about the transition actually my son did not want to come,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i ve got two kids he is now my daughter s,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
he did not want to come to los angeles,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
he loved it but he had a girlfriend in england this was the love of his life sarah he d known her for a month,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
mind you they would had their fourth anniversary because it is a long time when you are,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
he was really upset on the plane he said i ll never find another girl like sarah and we were rather pleased about that frankly because she was the main reason we were leaving the country,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
but something strikes you when you move to america and travel around the world every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects every one doesn t matter where you go you d think it would be otherwise but it isn t at the top are mathematics and languages then the humanities at the bottom are the arts everywhere on earth,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and in pretty much every system too there is a hierarchy within the arts art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there is not an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics why why not,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i think this is rather important,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i think math is very important but so is dance,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
children dance all the time if they are allowed to we all do,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we all have bodies do not we did i miss a meeting,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
truthfully what happens is as children grow up we start to educate them progressively from the waist up and then we focus on their heads and slightly to one side,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if you were to visit education as an alien and say what s it for public education,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i think you would have to conclude if you look at the output who really succeeds by this who does everything they should who gets all the brownie points who are the winners i think you would have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors isn t it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they re the people who come out the top and i used to be one so there,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
and i like university professors but you know we should not hold them up as the high water mark of all human achievement they re just a form of life another form of life,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but they are rather curious,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and i say this out of affection for them there is something curious about professors in my experience not all of them but typically they live in their heads,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they live up there and slightly to one side they re disembodied you know in a kind of literal way they look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
don t they,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
it s a way of getting their head to meetings,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
if you want real evidence of out of body experiences by the way get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
and there you will see it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
grown men and women writhing uncontrollably off the beat waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability and there is a reason,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
around the world there were no public systems of education really before the th century they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas number one that the most useful subjects for work are at the top,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
so you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid things you liked on the grounds you would never get a job doing that,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
is that right,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
don t do music you are not going to be a musician do not do art you will not be an artist,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
benign advice now profoundly mistaken,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
the whole world is engulfed in a revolution,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and the second is academic ability which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence because the universities design the system in their image,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
if you think of it the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and the consequence is that many highly talented brilliant creative people think they are not because the thing they were good at at school was not valued or was actually stigmatized,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and i think we cannot afford to go on that way,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in the next years according to unesco more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history more people,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and it is the combination of all the things we have talked about technology and its transformational effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
suddenly degrees are not worth anything isn t that true,FALSE,TRUE,bad,,,,,,
when i was a student if you had a degree you had a job if you did not have a job it is because you did not want one and i did not want one frankly,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
but now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games because you need an ma where the previous job required a ba and now you need a phd for the other,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s a process of academic inflation,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
and it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we need to radically rethink our view of intelligence,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we know three things about intelligence,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
one it is diverse we think about the world in all the ways that we experience it we think visually we think in sound we think kinesthetically we think in abstract terms we think in movement,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
secondly intelligence is dynamic if you look at the interactions of a human brain as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive the brain is not divided into compartments,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
in fact creativity which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
by the way there is a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum it s thicker in women following off from helen yesterday this is probably why women are better at multitasking because you are are not you,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there s a raft of research but i know it from my personal life if my wife is cooking a meal at home which is not often thankfully,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
no she is good at some things,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but if she is cooking she is dealing with people on the phone she is talking to the kids she is painting the ceiling she is doing open heart surgery over here,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
if i m cooking the door is shut the kids are out the phone s on the hook if she comes in i get annoyed i say terry please i m trying to fry an egg in here give me a break,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
actually do you know that old philosophical thing if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it did it happen,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
remember that old chestnut,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i saw a great t shirt recently which said if a man speaks his mind in a forest and no woman hears him is he still wrong,TRUE,TRUE,good,,,,,,
and the third thing about intelligence is it is distinct,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i m doing a new book at the moment called epiphany which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i m fascinated by how people got to be there,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it s really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of gillian lynne have you heard of her some have,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
she s a choreographer and everybody knows her work she did cats and phantom of the opera she s wonderful,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i used to be on the board of the royal ballet as you can see,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
gillian and i had lunch one day i said how did you get to be a dancer,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
it was interesting when she was at school she was really hopeless and the school in the s wrote to her parents and said we think gillian has a learning disorder she could not concentrate she was fidgeting,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i think now they would say she had adhd wouldn t you,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but this was the s and adhd had not been invented at this point it was not an available condition,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
people were not aware they could have that,TRUE,FALSE,bad,,,,,,
anyway she went to see this specialist so this oak paneled room and she was there with her mother and she was led and sat on this chair at the end and she sat on her hands for minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems gillian was having at school because she was disturbing people her homework was always late and so on little kid of eight in the end the doctor went and sat next to gillian and said i ve listened to all these things your mother s told me i need to speak to her privately wait here we ll be back we will not be very long and they went and left her,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
but as they went out of the room he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk and when they got out of the room he said to her mother just stand and watch her and the minute they left the room she was on her feet moving to the music and they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said mrs lynne gillian is not sick she s a dancer take her to a dance school,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i said what happened she said she did i cannot tell you how wonderful it was we walked in this room and it was full of people like me people who could not sit still people who had to move to think who had to move to think,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
they did ballet they did tap jazz they did modern they did contemporary,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
she was eventually auditioned for the royal ballet school,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
she became a soloist she had a wonderful career at the royal ballet,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
she eventually graduated from the royal ballet school founded the gillian lynne dance company met andrew lloyd webber,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
she s been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history she is given pleasure to millions and she is a multimillionaire,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
what i think it comes to is this al gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by rachel carson,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
i believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip mine the earth for a particular commodity and for the future it will not serve us,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we are educating our children,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
there was a wonderful quote by jonas salk who said if all the insects were to disappear from the earth within years all life on earth would end if all human beings disappeared from the earth within years all forms of life would flourish and he is right,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
what ted celebrates is the gift of the human imagination,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we have talked about and the only way we will do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are and our task is to educate their whole being so they can face this future,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
by the way we may not see this future but they will and our job is to help them make something of it,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
thank you very much,FALSE,FALSE,good,,,,,,
