0,okay hello and welcome to a coding challenge,False,False,good,231.0,250.0,0.4802494802494803
1,google chrome dinosaur game edition,False,True,bad,,,
2,unfortunately i do not have my train whistle,False,True,bad,,,
3,i did not bring it with me today,False,True,bad,,,
4,so this is definitely not going to go well,True,True,good,,,
5,not that any of my coding challenges ever go well but i m going to give this a try,True,False,bad,,,
6,i m going to attempt to program quickly,False,False,good,,,
7,the google chrome dinosaur game,False,True,bad,,,
8,i m going to use my own images and stuff,False,False,good,,,
9,so it will be the unicorn game of course,False,True,bad,,,
10,i m going to use p jess the javascript library p jess and i m going to interact with it in a unique way that you have to stick around for the end of the video,False,False,good,,,
11,i ll just tell you now,False,True,bad,,,
12,i m going to try to control with my voice,False,False,good,,,
13,okay so you skip to the end,False,True,bad,,,
14,maybe i ll be doing it there,False,True,bad,,,
15,okay so here we go,False,True,bad,,,
16,let s get started,False,True,bad,,,
17,so what do i need to do,False,False,good,,,
18,so first i m going to make a i m going to add i m going to the p web editor,False,True,bad,,,
19,i m going to add a file,False,False,good,,,
20,i m going to call it a dyno js,False,True,bad,,,
21,even though it is not let us call it unicorn,False,True,bad,,,
22,unicorn js,False,True,bad,,,
23,and that is going to be my unicorn,False,True,bad,,,
24,and what do i need,False,False,good,,,
25,i also need to have those are like cactus thingies,True,True,good,,,
26,i mean those are going to be trains,False,True,bad,,,
27,so i m going to make a train js add file,False,True,bad,,,
28,so let us start by creating the unicorn class unicorn,False,False,good,,,
29,so i m going to use object oriented programming because you know i do basically this by the way is exactly the same as slapy bird,False,True,bad,,,
30,so i m really just doing the same thing over again but whatever,True,True,good,,,
31,this is a nice beginner friendly challenge,False,False,good,,,
32,so and maybe using object oriented programming is a little bit overkill,True,True,good,,,
33,but let us give the unicorn a x location at and a y location which will be height because it is sitting at the bottom of the window but maybe i ll say like height minus right now,False,True,bad,,,
34,and then i m going to create a function called show and i m going to draw it,False,False,good,,,
35,i m just going to draw as a rectangle right now at this x this y and i ll make it,False,True,bad,,,
36,so this is the unicorn class,False,True,bad,,,
37,a unicorn object has an x and a y and when i draw it it is a rectangle at that x and a y with a width and height of,False,False,good,,,
38,and those will probably need to be variables eventually,False,False,good,,,
39,so let me make a variable called unicorn,False,False,good,,,
40,i m going to say unicorn is a new unicorn and i m going to say here unicorn show,False,True,bad,,,
41,and let us run this,False,True,bad,,,
42,there we go,False,True,bad,,,
43,oh ok,False,True,bad,,,
44,so of course i forgot what i always forget which is that i ve added some new javascript files and i need to reference them in my html,True,True,good,,,
45,unicorn and what was the other thing called train,False,True,bad,,,
46,all right,False,False,good,,,
47,so that is a unicorn,False,True,bad,,,
48,and what i want is but let me play that game again,False,True,bad,,,
49,how does it work,False,False,good,,,
50,it just sits there,False,True,bad,,,
51,so every time i press the space bar it jumps,False,True,bad,,,
52,so let us get it to do that first,False,False,good,,,
53,let s get it to do that first,False,False,good,,,
54,so what does it need in order to be able to jump,False,False,good,,,
55,it needs a velocity a speed along the y axis,False,False,good,,,
56,so let us call this vy and we will say that is zero,False,True,bad,,,
57,and we will write a function called jump which we will give it kind of this like instant force,False,True,bad,,,
58,so we are going to like push it up,False,False,good,,,
59,so i m going to say this dot vy equals let us say like negative five,False,True,bad,,,
60,that s moving it up,False,True,bad,,,
61,and then i m going to write a function called move which says this dot y plus equals this dot vy,False,False,good,,,
62,so what we should see now is if i say unicorn dot move and then if i add function key pressed and say if the key is the space bar unicorn dot jump,False,True,bad,,,
63,this really is basically the same as flappy birds so far,False,True,bad,,,
64,then we should see that velocity kick in,False,False,good,,,
65,so i m always moving it based on whatever that velocity is,False,True,bad,,,
66,but the velocity is zero the speed is zero,False,False,good,,,
67,but as soon as i say jump it sets the speed to negative five and we should start to see it move up,False,True,bad,,,
68,here we go,False,True,bad,,,
69,and i m moving along here,False,False,good,,,
70,i m going to press space,False,False,good,,,
71,there we go,False,True,bad,,,
72,ah goodbye unicorn,True,True,good,,,
73,see you later,True,True,good,,,
74,all right,False,False,good,,,
75,so we need gravity,False,False,good,,,
76,so we need some form of gravity which probably makes sense as a global variable but i m just going to since the gravity is really only going to affect the unicorn,False,True,bad,,,
77,i m going to put it in here,False,True,bad,,,
78,let s say it is a zero point five,False,False,good,,,
79,so gravity is in a way a counteracting force,False,False,good,,,
80,so no matter what it is doing the gravity is always adjusting the speed of the unicorn the acceleration basically,False,True,bad,,,
81,so what i can do now also in move is say this dot vy plus equal this dot gravity,False,True,bad,,,
82,however i do not want to ever let because now it is gone,False,False,good,,,
83,i do not want to ever let the unicorn fall off the bottom,False,True,bad,,,
84,it should be basically a ground level,False,False,good,,,
85,so i m going to do that,False,False,good,,,
86,so let us make this a size,False,True,bad,,,
87,let s say r equals,False,False,good,,,
88,so we are going to kind of use that for all the parts where we are drawing,False,False,good,,,
89,and then i m also going to say i m going to have a constraint,False,False,good,,,
90,so i m going to say this dot y equals constraint,False,False,good,,,
91,it s current y value between zero and really where it is sitting at the bottom which is also height minus this dot r so it is stuck there,False,True,bad,,,
92,and now if i press oops press space you can see it jumps,False,True,bad,,,
93,now that is a very measly little jump,True,True,good,,,
94,we need to be able to jump much more,False,False,good,,,
95,so let us set this to like,False,False,good,,,
96,and let us see what happens,False,True,bad,,,
97,okay,False,True,bad,,,
98,that s too much,True,False,bad,,,
99,let s just set it to,False,True,bad,,,
100,maybe i need to make the gravity stronger too,False,False,good,,,
101,so there is going to be a lot of fine tuning of this,False,False,good,,,
102,but let us just do that,False,False,good,,,
103,and let me set this to,False,False,good,,,
104,whoops,True,True,good,,,
105,and maybe let us set the gravity to two,False,True,bad,,,
106,there we go,False,True,bad,,,
107,this feels a bit more like the dinosaur game,False,True,bad,,,
108,so this is kind of sad,True,True,good,,,
109,let s make our unicorn look a little bit more exciting,False,True,bad,,,
110,let s load an image,False,False,good,,,
111,so i have on the desktop here i have some images,False,False,good,,,
112,i have a background which will be the background of the game,False,False,good,,,
113,i have a unicorn,False,True,bad,,,
114,this will be the character with a little angry equal sign sitting on it,False,True,bad,,,
115,and then the train will be the thing and has to jump over,False,True,bad,,,
116,so let s so what i m going to do here is i m going to add these files,False,False,good,,,
117,i m going to add file,False,True,bad,,,
118,and i m going to drag them in to the web editor,False,True,bad,,,
119,it uploaded all of them,False,True,bad,,,
120,and then in here i m going to add preload,False,True,bad,,,
121,and i m going to have let you image let t image and let background image,False,False,good,,,
122,and let us load all those,False,True,bad,,,
123,u image equals load image unicorn png,False,True,bad,,,
124,and we are doing the same,False,False,good,,,
125,for t image and background image this is train,False,True,bad,,,
126,and this is background,False,False,good,,,
127,let s change the background to ooh,False,True,bad,,,
128,so what did i get wrong here,False,True,bad,,,
129,background is actually a jpeg,False,False,good,,,
130,so let us have the background now be background image,False,False,good,,,
131,there we go,False,True,bad,,,
132,and let us have the unicorn,False,True,bad,,,
133,where is it be,False,False,good,,,
134,i m going to say image unicorn image,False,True,bad,,,
135,there we go,False,True,bad,,,
136,it s so tiny,True,False,bad,,,
137,oh it is not pixelated,True,True,good,,,
138,it s so sad,True,True,good,,,
139,let s change this to,False,True,bad,,,
140,that s but it is x value should not be here,False,True,bad,,,
141,there we go,False,True,bad,,,
142,so there is our jumping unicorn,True,True,good,,,
143,this is not a lot of screen real estate to work with,False,True,bad,,,
144,so let me actually load a background image that is pixels wide which i think will be a little better than,False,False,good,,,
145,all right my unicorn can jump,False,True,bad,,,
146,and i ve made the background a little wider which means now i need obstacles for it to jump over,False,False,good,,,
147,and those are going to be little train things,False,True,bad,,,
148,so i m going to make another class call it a train,False,True,bad,,,
149,choo choo,True,True,good,,,
150,i m going to give that a constructor,False,False,good,,,
151,these will have also an x and a y,False,False,good,,,
152,so the x will be it is going to start off the edge,False,False,good,,,
153,and the y will be actually also at the bottom,False,True,bad,,,
154,so height minus i ll give it a size,False,True,bad,,,
155,and this dot r will be,False,True,bad,,,
156,and then so now i need a show function,False,True,bad,,,
157,and that i m going to draw as an image like fingers are in the wrong place the train image at x and y,False,False,good,,,
158,this dot r this dot r and let us also add a move function,False,True,bad,,,
159,and we will say this dot x minus equals,False,False,good,,,
160,and so the train so this is a weird thing,False,True,bad,,,
161,it s supposed to be oh this is going to be a problem,False,True,bad,,,
162,my fixed background is going to make this visually a problem,False,False,good,,,
163,and people on the chat are saying parallax background please,False,False,good,,,
164,all right so maybe i m going to get to that,False,False,good,,,
165,this is going to end up being a longer video if i implement that,False,True,bad,,,
166,but really the unicorn is moving,False,True,bad,,,
167,so the unicorn is moving but the x stays fixed,False,False,good,,,
168,the trains well the trains could be moving if they are trains,True,False,bad,,,
169,that s weird,True,True,good,,,
170,but they are supposed to be cactuses cacti,True,True,good,,,
171,they re standing still and the unicorn is just approaching them,False,False,good,,,
172,but we are seeing it from the unicorns point of view,False,False,good,,,
173,oh i ve really botched this,False,True,bad,,,
174,but what i m going to do is just move them by the whole scene is scrolling by three pixels,False,False,good,,,
175,and we will figure out if we can parallax the background maybe later,False,True,bad,,,
176,what do i even mean by parallax to make it appear as if the background is changing but often the distance so it is sort of moving at a different speed,False,False,good,,,
177,but for now let us just do this,False,True,bad,,,
178,let s create an array called trains,False,False,good,,,
179,and we are going to say train in setup,False,True,bad,,,
180,well actually you know what we are going to do in draw,False,True,bad,,,
181,we re just going to randomly,False,False,good,,,
182,we re going to pick a random number between and,False,False,good,,,
183,and we will say of the time we are going to say trains push,False,True,bad,,,
184,we re going to add a new train,False,True,bad,,,
185,so it is going to be irregular,False,False,good,,,
186,this is different than the flappy bird i made where the i think the pipes maybe it was a regular,False,True,bad,,,
187,i thought the pipes were regular intervals,False,False,good,,,
188,now there is a random chance of adding a new train,False,True,bad,,,
189,and then all of the trains that exist we are going to say four all of the train the dodged say t in trains,False,True,bad,,,
190,i m going to say t dot move t dot show,False,True,bad,,,
191,all right let us see what happens,False,True,bad,,,
192,do we have a train,False,True,bad,,,
193,maybe i better increase this,False,True,bad,,,
194,oh there we go,False,True,bad,,,
195,oh look at that,False,False,good,,,
196,all right they are moving,False,False,good,,,
197,they re kind of slow,False,True,bad,,,
198,i m going to jump over it,False,True,bad,,,
199,ok let us make them move a little faster,False,False,good,,,
200,so we have got some tweaking we have got to do,False,False,good,,,
201,whoa this is a nice way,True,True,good,,,
202,now look my unicorn can fly,True,True,good,,,
203,so i need to fix the fact i need to not allow my unicorn to fly right,True,True,good,,,
204,i should only be able to jump if i m at the bottom,False,True,bad,,,
205,so let us fix that,False,False,good,,,
206,so to do that i need to go into unicorn,False,True,bad,,,
207,and in the jump function i should only be allowed to jump if i m sitting at the bottom,False,True,bad,,,
208,so in other words if y is oh well if i m at the bottom,False,True,bad,,,
209,so as long as y is equal to is this really going to work,False,True,bad,,,
210,i do not like to use equal checks,False,True,bad,,,
211,but this is by definition sitting at the bottom,False,False,good,,,
212,so only if i m sitting at the bottom can i jump,False,True,bad,,,
213,so if y is equal to that spot let us see if that works,False,False,good,,,
214,so jump oops jump,True,True,good,,,
215,oh this dot y,False,True,bad,,,
216,come on trains,True,True,good,,,
217,oh yeah yep i can only jump when i m at the bottom,False,True,bad,,,
218,all right so that works,False,True,bad,,,
219,so that fixed,False,True,bad,,,
220,i think i need to be able to jump quite a bit higher,False,False,good,,,
221,let s try,False,False,good,,,
222,should really use like a slider or something,False,True,bad,,,
223,there we go,False,True,bad,,,
224,i think this is going to make the game more possible to win,False,False,good,,,
225,there s too many trains,True,False,bad,,,
226,too many trains,True,False,bad,,,
227,one thing that is bothering me is the trains are going in front of the unicorn,False,True,bad,,,
228,i know that does not really matter,False,False,good,,,
229,so much,False,False,good,,,
230,it s really does not matter,False,True,bad,,,
231,but i kind of would prefer them to be behind,False,True,bad,,,
232,so i m going to move this here,False,False,good,,,
233,i m also going to make the game a little easier to play,False,False,good,,,
234,i m going to reduce the number of trains,False,False,good,,,
235,so there is going to be a much lower probability of there being a train,False,True,bad,,,
236,let s see if i can actually play this game somewhat successfully even though i m not doing the collision checking yet,False,True,bad,,,
237,no,False,True,bad,,,
238,i think if the trains move faster it would actually make it easier,False,False,good,,,
239,so let us actually double the speed of the trains,False,True,bad,,,
240,all right,False,False,good,,,
241,this looks like this game is now possible to play,False,True,bad,,,
242,but i need to add collision detection,False,True,bad,,,
243,so i ve done this before in plenty of other coding challenges,False,False,good,,,
244,there s a pretty simple algorithm to just check if two rectangles are intersecting with each other or not,False,False,good,,,
245,i can just check their x s and y,False,True,bad,,,
246,they re basically all of the edges the left the right the top the bottom against each other,False,False,good,,,
247,but this is a nice opportunity for me to just explore a library that is out there in the world,False,False,good,,,
248,and this library is called p collide d,False,False,good,,,
249,and it actually has a function that it called collide rectangle rectangle,False,False,good,,,
250,and it will give me a boolean variable if i give it the x y with height of one rectangle and the x y with height of another rectangle,False,False,good,,,
251,so let us actually just use this library,False,False,good,,,
252,this is also a nice excuse for me to show you that github is now integrated with something called jsdeliver,False,True,bad,,,
253,so this is an open source content delivery network meaning if a javascript file is hosted on github i do not have to download that file and then add it to my project,False,False,good,,,
254,i can just link to it,False,False,good,,,
255,so i m going to go over here to github,False,True,bad,,,
256,there s lots of different ways here that i can reference a file on github,False,True,bad,,,
257,i think the easiest way for what i m doing right now is just to reference its path,False,False,good,,,
258,and here s an example path,False,False,good,,,
259,so i m going to go over here to index html,False,True,bad,,,
260,i m going to add another script tag,False,True,bad,,,
261,i m going to say script source equals,False,False,good,,,
262,i m going to paste that in closed script,False,True,bad,,,
263,but this is not the path that i want,False,False,good,,,
264,i want the username which is b m o r e n and then i want the path to let us get the minified version of the library,False,True,bad,,,
265,and that would just be this right there in the root directory,False,True,bad,,,
266,so now i m just referencing that file,False,True,bad,,,
267,let s see if that works,False,True,bad,,,
268,this is actually not correct,False,True,bad,,,
269,i m referencing the cdn url the username but i also need the repo name,False,True,bad,,,
270,so that should be p collide d slash this,False,True,bad,,,
271,so this should now work,False,True,bad,,,
272,and i should be able to use the collide function,False,True,bad,,,
273,so i m going to use this collide rectangle rectangle,False,False,good,,,
274,let me just call this in draw to see if that works,False,False,good,,,
275,and it does not give me an error,False,False,good,,,
276,great,True,True,good,,,
277,no error,True,True,good,,,
278,and so now i can check when i m going through all of the trains if unicorn hits t console log game over,False,True,bad,,,
279,so console log game over,False,True,bad,,,
280,and then i m actually going to say no loop,False,True,bad,,,
281,so i m just going to actually stop the sketch shut down the sketch completely which is not a really thoughtful user experience design choice,False,True,bad,,,
282,but it is what i m going to do for right now,False,False,good,,,
283,and then i just need to add a function here called hits and receives a train,False,True,bad,,,
284,and i can use this function which i need this x this y this r this r,False,False,good,,,
285,and then i need exactly the same thing but with that particular train,False,True,bad,,,
286,so instead of this i m checking this rectangle with this trains rectangle,False,False,good,,,
287,and i m going to put this in a variable called collide,False,False,good,,,
288,and i m going to say if i am going to return that,False,True,bad,,,
289,i can actually you know what,False,True,bad,,,
290,i m just returning this,False,True,bad,,,
291,return that,False,True,bad,,,
292,so return the true or false result of this collide function from that library,False,True,bad,,,
293,and now let us run the game,False,True,bad,,,
294,i ll wait for our first train,False,True,bad,,,
295,game over,False,True,bad,,,
296,let s see if i can play it now,False,True,bad,,,
297,oh there are so many trains oh well you are hooked,True,True,good,,,
298,let s make the train a little bit smaller,False,False,good,,,
299,and actually let us make the unicorn smaller as well,False,True,bad,,,
300,hopefully this will help,False,False,good,,,
301,all right let us draw the box,False,False,good,,,
302,let s debug this a little bit by drawing the box like very subtly,False,False,good,,,
303,so let us draw a very slight rectangle,False,False,good,,,
304,this is what we are actually checking,False,False,good,,,
305,there we go,False,True,bad,,,
306,it helps to see the full box,False,False,good,,,
307,come on trains,False,True,bad,,,
308,spawning a train with a mouse click would be a good idea,False,True,bad,,,
309,ok we lost,False,True,bad,,,
310,all right so there is obviously a lot of gameplay improvements that need to happen here,False,False,good,,,
311,one is i could be more thoughtful about you can see how there is some wasted space here,False,True,bad,,,
312,i should crop the image and the actual rectangle a little bit smaller,False,True,bad,,,
313,i could consider using a circle,False,False,good,,,
314,i could use a more complex shape,False,True,bad,,,
315,but this is good enough for right now,False,True,bad,,,
316,let s actually make it,False,False,good,,,
317,i could also just click the mouse in order to start a train that actually might help things,False,False,good,,,
318,but let me comment out this,False,False,good,,,
319,and what i want to do just before i go before i finish saying you are going to make a version of this with a score and all sorts of nicer things and sounds,False,True,bad,,,
320,but i ve got to finish this off,False,False,good,,,
321,i ve got to finish this video,False,True,bad,,,
322,i want to control the train with my voice,False,False,good,,,
323,so to do that i m going to use ml js which has a speech commands machine learning model built into this javascript library,False,False,good,,,
324,so i made a whole separate video about this particular pre trained model and how it works,False,False,good,,,
325,so i m just going to add it pretty quickly into this video,False,True,bad,,,
326,you can go watch the other one for more details,False,True,bad,,,
327,but if you are looking for the documentation if i click on reference and go to sound classifier this is what i m looking at doing,False,False,good,,,
328,so all i need to first thing i need to do is well actually one thing i need to do is i need to go to get started,False,True,bad,,,
329,and i need to get a script tag to be able to reference the library,False,False,good,,,
330,so i want to add the ml library,False,False,good,,,
331,so i m copying this,False,True,bad,,,
332,i m going here to index the html,False,True,bad,,,
333,so in addition to p cly d i m now adding ml,False,True,bad,,,
334,and i m going to go here,False,False,good,,,
335,and i m going to in preload,False,True,bad,,,
336,i m going to do let sound classifier create a variable in preload,False,False,good,,,
337,i m going to say sound classifier equals ml sound classifier,False,True,bad,,,
338,and the model i m loading is called speech commands w,False,True,bad,,,
339,because this is a model that is been trained to recognize particular words,False,False,good,,,
340,zero the digits zero through nine up down left right and a few other ones that are documented on this ml webpage,False,False,good,,,
341,let s go look that up real quick,False,True,bad,,,
342,so if i go back to sound classifier up down left right go stop yes no,False,True,bad,,,
343,so those are the words it is trained to recognize,False,False,good,,,
344,and i actually also want to get this probability threshold,False,False,good,,,
345,so i m going to add this in here because i want it to be really sure i m saying jump,False,True,bad,,,
346,so i m going to make this,False,False,good,,,
347,this means it is got to be sure,False,False,good,,,
348,the confidence score that is coming from that particular model,False,False,good,,,
349,and how that model was trained and there is all the paper you can read,False,False,good,,,
350,and i ve talked about that more in the other video,False,True,bad,,,
351,so now that i have that in setup i can say sound classifier classify then i can get a function,False,False,good,,,
352,i m going to call it got word,False,True,bad,,,
353,we re got command,False,False,good,,,
354,let s call it got command,False,True,bad,,,
355,so this is a callback function that is going to trigger any time it gets a command,False,True,bad,,,
356,it gets an error first error first callbacks and then the results,False,True,bad,,,
357,so i m just going to say if there is an error i m just going to console error the error,False,True,bad,,,
358,otherwise if results index dot label,False,True,bad,,,
359,so results as an array with labels and confidence scores,False,False,good,,,
360,the labels are the words,False,False,good,,,
361,and what i m looking for is the word up,False,True,bad,,,
362,if that label is up then unicorn jump,False,True,bad,,,
363,so this is a really quick way of me looking for a particular keyword from that library,False,False,good,,,
364,and i m also just going to console log results index dot label,False,False,good,,,
365,just to see if i m getting other words also,False,True,bad,,,
366,and we might as well log the confidence score just so we can see that,False,False,good,,,
367,that might be good for debugging as well,False,True,bad,,,
368,so now that i ve logged those two things i m going to run this sketch,False,False,good,,,
369,shoot,True,True,good,,,
370,but you can see it got up,False,True,bad,,,
371,i m going to add the thing where i click the mouse and i can give myself a train,False,True,bad,,,
372,and in fact let us comment out the random trains,False,True,bad,,,
373,also i really should be more thoughtful about how i m picking the train,False,True,bad,,,
374,like when the train should come like maybe there is a minimum distance between them,False,True,bad,,,
375,if i ve just added one can i have a longer train with other train cars,False,True,bad,,,
376,i do not know what is going on here,False,False,good,,,
377,there s a lot of narrative flaws in what is going on here,True,False,bad,,,
378,but i m just going to add one myself,False,True,bad,,,
379,up,False,True,bad,,,
380,yes,False,True,bad,,,
381,up,False,True,bad,,,
382,shoot,False,True,bad,,,
383,all right,False,False,good,,,
384,everyone is making the suggestion in the chat that i should change it to a circle,False,True,bad,,,
385,so that ll actually kind of be like around it,False,True,bad,,,
386,it ll give me a little wiggle room along the edges and make the intersection happen a little less often,False,False,good,,,
387,so let us actually go ahead and do that,False,False,good,,,
388,so i m going to go into where the only place where i m doing this collision detection is where in the unicorn under hits,False,True,bad,,,
389,so i m going to change this to collide circle circle collide circle circle and circle to circle assumes ellipse mode center,False,False,good,,,
390,so i m going to have to think of the circle as the center point of the object which is not a big deal,False,False,good,,,
391,so the way that i m going to do that let us make some separate variables,False,False,good,,,
392,let s say x equals this dot x plus this dot r times,False,False,good,,,
393,so this would be the middle,False,False,good,,,
394,this is the middle,False,False,good,,,
395,and then r is the diameter of the circle,False,False,good,,,
396,so that is fine,False,True,bad,,,
397,this is y,False,False,good,,,
398,and then x y is the train,False,True,bad,,,
399,train dot x train dot y train dot r train dot r and so now i want collide circle circle x y and then x y,False,True,bad,,,
400,the question is is r for actually the radius or is it the diameter,False,False,good,,,
401,does it say circle diameter circle diameter,False,False,good,,,
402,so i m good,False,True,bad,,,
403,all right so let us try this,False,False,good,,,
404,and then this should really be oh this is kind of unfortunate,False,True,bad,,,
405,this should now be an ellipse,False,False,good,,,
406,oh you know what i can just do,False,True,bad,,,
407,i can say ellipse mode corner perfect,False,False,good,,,
408,so let us draw the hit circles under train,False,False,good,,,
409,let s do the same thing here and say ellipse there,False,False,good,,,
410,so this should now we should see,False,False,good,,,
411,here we go,False,True,bad,,,
412,that s what it is going to do,False,False,good,,,
413,ok here we go,False,False,good,,,
414,oh after click,False,True,bad,,,
415,oh what happened,False,True,bad,,,
416,all right i passed r in twice which is very unnecessary,False,True,bad,,,
417,you just give it the diameter not the radius even though i m calling it r once,False,True,bad,,,
418,and let us see what happens,False,True,bad,,,
419,ok here we go,False,False,good,,,
420,jump,False,True,bad,,,
421,why is my browser really freaking out,True,True,good,,,
422,let s comment out the debugging,False,True,bad,,,
423,we re just going to go for it now,False,True,bad,,,
424,we re going to play this game and close this tab,False,True,bad,,,
425,quick chrome,True,True,good,,,
426,we re about to play this game,True,False,bad,,,
427,oh up,True,True,good,,,
428,it s up,True,True,good,,,
429,i m saying jump,True,True,good,,,
430,so up,True,True,good,,,
431,yeah there we go,False,True,bad,,,
432,up,True,True,good,,,
433,up,True,True,good,,,
434,up,True,True,good,,,

445,look at me,True,False,bad,,,
446,i guess i cannot use the music,True,True,good,,,
447,up,True,True,good,,,
448,up,True,True,good,,,
449,up,True,True,good,,,
450,ah,True,True,good,,,
451,all right everyone,False,False,good,,,
452,thus ends this coding challenge,False,True,bad,,,
453,there are so many things that need to be added to this,False,False,good,,,
454,number one the narrative is makes no sense,False,False,good,,,
455,why is there this unicorn standing still,False,True,bad,,,
456,without any animation,False,True,bad,,,
457,the trains are coming at it,False,False,good,,,
458,the background should be sort of like in parallax moving,False,False,good,,,
459,so probably it should be jumping over,False,True,bad,,,
460,i should have just used cacti,False,True,bad,,,
461,that s the plural of cactus right,True,True,good,,,
462,there s no score,False,True,bad,,,
463,there s no birds flying,False,True,bad,,,
464,you could add a flying asterisk,False,True,bad,,,
465,i m going to when i upload this i m going to include when i when this video publishes and with the code i will include a lot of the coding train characters which are designed by jason heggland so i m going to include a whole bunch of those,False,False,good,,,
466,if people want to make a version of this game that we can all play online with speech commands,False,False,good,,,
467,let me try this,False,False,good,,,
468,i m going to just say goodbye by trying this one more sentence,False,False,good,,,
469,yes alka is pointing out that speech detection i behind the browser might be lower latency but let us try this one more time,False,True,bad,,,
470,up,False,True,bad,,,
471,up,False,True,bad,,,
472,up,False,True,bad,,,
473,up,False,True,bad,,,
474,up,False,True,bad,,,
475,up,False,True,bad,,,
476,up,False,True,bad,,,
477,oh okay,False,True,bad,,,
478,goodbye everyone,False,True,bad,,,
479,thank you very much,False,False,good,,,
480,and see you later on a future coding challenge,False,True,bad,,,
