i know what you are thinking,False,False,good,,,,,,
we re going to laugh at that monkey are not we,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and yes we certainly are,False,False,good,,,,,,
but you should know the monkeys are laughing right back at you,True,True,good,,,,,,
what with your little floppy ass,True,False,bad,,,,,,
well we will get to that,False,False,good,,,,,,
but first let me tell you about these monkeys,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is the probossus monkey which has a very unusual feet or i d say it has a big nose,False,False,good,,,,,,
like rest on your chin you could teabag yourself sort of nose,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it is out of proportion compared to our proportions anyway and we find that funny,False,True,bad,,,,,,
in nerd the probossus monkey is called nezellus lervatus which roughly translates to nose like a mask,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the person who named it that probably dressed up as a dick for halloween,True,True,good,,,,,,
you know like they had a mask that looked like a well you get it,False,False,good,,,,,,
in any case the probossus monkey is part of a group of monkeys called the ardnosed colibines,False,False,good,,,,,,
another monkey in that group is rhino pythagus which roughly translates to nose monkey,False,False,good,,,,,,
a name given to a monkey that barely has a nose at all,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this snub nosed monkey can look a bit like it snorted lots of cocaine through a pair of scissors,False,False,good,,,,,,
but it is not a nut nosed though,False,False,good,,,,,,
from the side you can see it is just very small and upturned,False,False,good,,,,,,
sure i think it is a bit messed up to single out a few related monkeys and call them ardnosed,False,False,good,,,,,,
but characterizing monkeys by their noses is apparently the hot thing to do for the science hippies,True,True,good,,,,,,
monkeys are basically divided into two main groups platarini and catarini,False,False,good,,,,,,
platarini means flat nose,False,False,good,,,,,,
these are the new world monkeys who often have sideways facing wide sit nostrils like squirrel monkeys or tamarins,False,False,good,,,,,,
catarini means down nosed,False,False,good,,,,,,
and these are the old world monkeys including macaques and apes,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the mandrel which at least deserves a runner up in the ardnosed category,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean it looks like it re rendered a unicorn that was stopped at a traffic light,True,False,bad,,,,,,
all the way up to the eyes,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the prabasas monkey is a down nosed monkey that took the concept and just ran with it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
in males the external portion of their nose the part that is outside the skull can grow so large you cannot play got your nose with them,False,False,good,,,,,,
you d have to use your whole fist,False,False,good,,,,,,
they do not have to cut their hands to smell their breath though and that is a plus,False,False,good,,,,,,
but listen there is someone else in the down nosed group with an unusually big external nose,False,False,good,,,,,,
the second biggest,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s us,False,False,good,,,,,,
i know what you are thinking,False,False,good,,,,,,
my nose is not that big,True,False,bad,,,,,,
of course it is,True,False,bad,,,,,,
look at that fleshy pyramid sticking out like that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i mean come on we have to tilt our friggin head to the side when we want a kiss,True,False,bad,,,,,,
snub nosed monkey can kiss straight on no problem,False,True,bad,,,,,,
i mean if one of them sneezes the other one might toot a little but that is alright,True,True,good,,,,,,
i m telling you we look hilarious,True,True,good,,,,,,
what,False,False,good,,,,,,
no jerry i m not going to talk about the erections,True,True,good,,,,,,
yet,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now the male prabasas monkeys profound mezality is most likely the result of sexual selection which is the corner of evolution where all the weird shit happens,True,True,good,,,,,,
there are a couple ways it can go down,False,False,good,,,,,,
one way is driven by how females decide which male to get busy with,False,False,good,,,,,,
for example let us take these birds here,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s say a female has a gene that makes her attracted to a longer tail,False,False,good,,,,,,
now she gets out there and gets down with a longer tailed male,False,False,good,,,,,,
now the gene for longer tailed males and the gene for being attracted to longer tailed males get passed on,False,False,good,,,,,,
and now you have got males with longer tails,False,False,good,,,,,,
but if females are attracted to longer tails then she is going to choose males with longer longer tails,False,False,good,,,,,,
but that on repeat and see what happens,False,True,bad,,,,,,
in the case of the sacraboli you wind up with more tail and bird,False,False,good,,,,,,
congrats you are a sexy bird now but you have the flying style of a floppy trash bag that is been caught in a whirl of wind,False,True,bad,,,,,,
these outsized male ornaments can also become linked to other favorable traits,False,False,good,,,,,,
in the sense that a peacock s tail might give you clues about the peacock s fuck,True,True,good,,,,,,
well if it had one but you get the point even if the p hen doesn t,False,False,good,,,,,,
glowaca jokes,False,False,good,,,,,,
in the case of the probasus male a large nose is correlated to a larger body mass and larger testicular size,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that means more sperm and a greater chance of getting pricked,False,False,good,,,,,,
but listen monkeys are naked and it is not that hard to see how big they are and how big their testicles are especially with the whole erection thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
but it is not time for that,False,False,good,,,,,,
yet i know what you are thinking sweaty nipples,True,True,good,,,,,,
maybe our unusually large human noses correlate to the size of something else on our bodies,False,False,good,,,,,,
is the size of our nose related to the size of another sticking out bit,False,False,good,,,,,,
well let me tell you,False,False,good,,,,,,
just last year there was a study in japan where the science hippies took a bunch of dead people pretty sure they were dead already and what they did was measure their noses and then compared that to their spl or stretched penis length which is apparently some sort of standard way of measuring a penis,False,False,good,,,,,,
news to me i ve been doing it all wrong and what they found were that the two measurements were highly related,False,False,good,,,,,,
a bigger nose meant a bigger spl,False,False,good,,,,,,
now that is not to suggest that our noses are the product of female choice sexual selection and that might only be part of the story with the pervasus monkey,False,False,good,,,,,,
but female choice is not the only flavor of sexual selection,False,False,good,,,,,,
another driver is competition between males,False,False,good,,,,,,
when the bros have to fight each other to gain access to females adaptations that help them when a fight are selected for,False,False,good,,,,,,
often this results in the evolution of weaponry like long canines or tusks even in animals that only eat leaves or vegetables,False,False,good,,,,,,
the pervasus males have quite a bit of competing to do,False,False,good,,,,,,
their social system is organized into herons where one male has access to a number of females,False,False,good,,,,,,
i know what you are thinking those noses do not look like weapons to me unless you count a good noodle slapping but they still can be used in combat,True,False,bad,,,,,,
sort of,False,False,good,,,,,,
these monkey herons often live close to one another and females sometimes decide to move between them,False,False,good,,,,,,
so there is plenty of opportunities for fights as males defend their turf,False,False,good,,,,,,
but fighting is a real bummer,False,False,good,,,,,,
sorry but fighting is a real bummer,False,True,bad,,,,,,
they can get hurt,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they have not invented the band aid yet,True,False,bad,,,,,,
why would they with all that fur it would be a right pitch to take off,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so if there is a way a monkey can predict that he is likely to lose a fight before it happens that would certainly be useful in not getting dead,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now if you can see the size of your challenger you can just make good choices,False,False,good,,,,,,
but where they live the visibility is not that great,False,False,good,,,,,,
what with all the leaves,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is where the noises come in,False,False,good,,,,,,
propossus monkeys make a lot of noise,False,False,good,,,,,,
it can sound a bit like a donkey swallowed a dialop modem,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think you know where this is headed,False,False,good,,,,,,
a larger nose helps make a louder lower sound,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we already know that large noses correlate to large bodies,False,False,good,,,,,,
so a male can listen to another male s call and decide if he wants to rumble,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the females they are listening in too,False,False,good,,,,,,
because a louder sound means bigger testicles,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and telling you it is a whole thing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so the propossus nose might be a bit of a both end,True,False,bad,,,,,,
starting to evolve as a signal for males and then driven to extremes by female choice,False,False,good,,,,,,
these monkeys have something else that is both used to attract mates and to warn other males,False,False,good,,,,,,
go ahead jerry,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now humans have more of a right place right time sort of erection,False,True,bad,,,,,,
for the propossus monkey the time is always in the places everywhere,True,False,bad,,,,,,
they have a brightly colored and more or less permanent erection,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s not always turned up to,True,False,bad,,,,,,
there s the sort of everyday walking about erection,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this one s measuring his spl,False,False,good,,,,,,
and here s a more elegant cocktail party sort of erection,True,True,good,,,,,,
but they reserve a more straight up man spreading erection as a warning for when they are about to get aggressive,True,True,good,,,,,,
we do not do that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s a shame,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we d make mma weigh ins more exciting,True,False,bad,,,,,,
well conor mcgregor certainly showed up to fight,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but no we cannot even use ours to flag down a bus,True,False,bad,,,,,,
trust me i ve tried it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
bus kept going,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i know what you are going to say,False,False,good,,,,,,
i have read somewhere that the human male genitalia is proportionately larger than what the apes on the monkeys are carrying about,False,False,good,,,,,,
that is like the most human thing to think,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s like how everybody says their hometown has the best drinking water,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s bullshitt the researcher alan dixon son of dix so you know he is for real he looked into it and found that humans are pretty unremarkable and average down there,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but what about our big noses,False,False,good,,,,,,
there must be something special there,False,False,good,,,,,,
well no surprise the science hippies cannot even agree on it,True,True,good,,,,,,
one idea was that when we moved to colder places bigger noses were better at warming and moistening the air,False,False,good,,,,,,
that one s refuted,False,False,good,,,,,,
not just futed,False,False,good,,,,,,
they futed it again,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s another idea that our big noses gave us stereo smell for navigation,False,False,good,,,,,,
not refuted yet,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then there is the simple idea that it is just the byproduct of our bigger brains,False,False,good,,,,,,
as our skulls got bigger our faces flattened leaving our nose out there like a little flesh island,False,False,good,,,,,,
so just remember if you want to laugh at a monkey with a big nose and a funny looking penis call up a friend and get naked,True,True,good,,,,,,
it s a hell of a lot cheaper than going to borneo,False,False,good,,,,,,
alright so you want a statue of the monkey right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
how big,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh that is big,True,False,bad,,,,,,
you want a realistic life like,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh okay,True,False,bad,,,,,,
well what about the erect,True,True,good,,,,,,
right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no i understand the tourists,True,False,bad,,,,,,
how about this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we put grapes in front of it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
yeah no that is no problem,True,False,bad,,,,,,
anything else,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh it is a fountain,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh that is new,True,False,bad,,,,,,
alright,True,False,bad,,,,,,
well in italy a lot of times the water comes out from the tip of the we re hear me out,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it would come up from behind the grapes in this really beautiful arc,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh i ve got it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we ll make it look like it is vomiting,True,False,bad,,,,,,
projectile vomiting,True,False,bad,,,,,,
all over everything,True,False,bad,,,,,,
hello and welcome to another coding challenge,False,False,good,,,,,,
well i m excited about this one,True,False,bad,,,,,,
in this coding challenge i m going to attempt to make this fern,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the barnsley fern named for the british mathematician michael barnsley,False,False,good,,,,,,
i encourage you to read this wikipedia page which will give you more background on it,False,False,good,,,,,,
what i m going to do is just look at the algorithm and try to write that algorithm into code and see if we can get that result,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then you the creative viewer of this coding challenge will make your own version with different colors,False,False,good,,,,,,
and you will think about animating it and do all sorts of things that i could not possibly even imagine,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so for what is the algorithm here,False,False,good,,,,,,
so if we look down here i m just going to skip down down here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it says the first point is drawn at the origin x equals y equals,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what this means is where you need some sort of two dimensional space,False,False,good,,,,,,
it could be a processing canvas and i want to start at,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now i m going to think of in the center here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i m going to have to probably figure out some ways of well the pixels are here but then on the pixel spaces here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but i m not going to worry about that right now,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then what is the next step,False,False,good,,,,,,
the next step is and then the new points are iteratively computed by randomly applying one of the four following coordinate transformations,False,False,good,,,,,,
and here they are to find out this is the kind of stuff that you might see and think ahh ok i m going to go do something else,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this looks like matrix math and linear algebra,False,False,good,,,,,,
but this is actually first of all if you watch some of my matrix videos this is going to strangely enough make sense to you,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but let me actually show you that this math is actually quite simple,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s use just this second one and let us rewrite this over on the board,False,False,good,,,,,,
so f of x y equals so i m going to have to go back and check it haha,True,True,good,,,,,,
,True,False,bad,,,,,,
negative negative i should have made up my own numbers haha,True,False,bad,,,,,,
,True,False,bad,,,,,,
then we have x y oh no i m running out of space,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m running out of space,True,False,bad,,,,,,
plus i can put this in,True,False,bad,,,,,,
you can see that and,False,False,good,,,,,,
what does this mean,True,False,bad,,,,,,
well this is actually the matrix product or the matrix multiplication or the dot product,False,False,good,,,,,,
what it means is i want to find the values,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if this is x y what i want to get is the next values for x,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i have one point and i want to know where does that point go,True,False,bad,,,,,,
what s x y,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so this being x equals this number times that sorry times x plus this number times that the row gets multiplied by the column times y,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then plus this number plus,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then y then equals negative times x plus and my handwriting s terrible times y this column times this column plus,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so it is really just this formula,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if i have an xy coordinate i get the next xy coordinate with this math,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we can just double check that this is right,False,False,good,,,,,,
look at that for a second with my horrible messy handwriting,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then let us go down here and see look at this,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s the same thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
x the next x is this number times the previous x plus this number times the previous y,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the next y is this number times the previous x plus this number times the previous y plus,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we just need to do one of these four,False,False,good,,,,,,
and each one of those four we do according to a particular probability,False,False,good,,,,,,
right,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh right abcde,True,False,bad,,,,,,
yep that could have written it this way,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that s the generic way of writing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
okay so all right so let us go back into that let us start writing some code,True,False,bad,,,,,,
all right so i have a processing sketch a java based programming environment with a nice api for drawing stuff and lots more processing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m going to say background equals zero,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m going to have an x aaand a y i m going to set those to be zero to start,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m going to draw i m going to say stroke,True,False,bad,,,,,,
,False,False,good,,,,,,
stroke weight,False,False,good,,,,,,
sorry stroke stroke weight eight,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then i m going to draw a point at x point y,True,False,bad,,,,,,
ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then what i need to do is get the next value,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so next x equals some number a times x plus b times y plus c and actually so let us just use these numbers here,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s just copy these,False,False,good,,,,,,
,True,False,bad,,,,,,
,False,False,good,,,,,,
negative,True,False,bad,,,,,,
negative,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and next y is negative,False,False,good,,,,,,
,False,False,good,,,,,,
,True,False,bad,,,,,,
,True,False,bad,,,,,,
,True,False,bad,,,,,,
,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no what is going on,True,False,bad,,,,,,
ok everything s fine now,True,False,bad,,,,,,
breathe everybody,False,False,good,,,,,,
breathe would be,False,False,good,,,,,,
okay so this is applying that particular transformation,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i could just say x equals next x y equals next y,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so what if i were to do this and run this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i do not get any errors,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i do see this circle over here being drawn,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so here s the thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m only applying one of those transformations,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i need to pick one of four,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i also am not thinking sort of thoughtfully about the pixel space,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i need to do a mapping right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
x with pixels goes from to to,False,False,good,,,,,,
but maybe i want to think of this as a space between negative and and negative and,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so what i want to do is say when i actually go to draw it pixel x equals map x which goes between negative and to and width and pixel y between negative and,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i m going to flip the axis height,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then i m going to draw the point at px py,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s run this,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then oh okay and then i only want to draw the background once,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and we can see there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
so if i apply that transformation over and over again we can see the point going up that way,False,False,good,,,,,,
now is that right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that looked weird to me,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this has to be y,False,False,good,,,,,,
yes this needs to be y i was like mapping the x value,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i was like why is it uh alright,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so uh mmm alright,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s not moving very much but that is fine,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m just applying this one transformation,True,False,bad,,,,,,
alright let us look at the values,False,False,good,,,,,,
just to sort of see what those values aaare doing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and we can see there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
now it kind of settled,True,False,bad,,,,,,
interestingly enough it settled to a fixed point,False,False,good,,,,,,
hmm,False,False,good,,,,,,
but here s the thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
we need to do one of four transformations,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i need to do the tedious thing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now i could probably write the encode these into arrays and like automatically,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i m going to do this in a very long winded way,True,False,bad,,,,,,
just to see the code,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to have four of these possibilities,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so this is actually number two,False,False,good,,,,,,
i need to have one,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i need to have three,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i need to have four,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i probably should put these in a function,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but oh there is so many ways i could organize the code to be better,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but i m going to just do it this way right now,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i m going to maybe i ll refactor it all later let you do that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so let us go back and look at the algorithm,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is just zero and point one six times y,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this one is actually just zero,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this is actually just zero point one zero point one six times y,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s option number one,True,False,bad,,,,,,
option number two we did,False,False,good,,,,,,
option number three,False,False,good,,,,,,
option number three is point two negative point two six point two negative zero point two six,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then point two three point two two one point six,False,False,good,,,,,,
point two three point two two two point six what that what it was,True,False,bad,,,,,,
one point six,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then option number four is negative point one five point two eight,False,False,good,,,,,,
you re really watching me do this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
negative one five and two eight,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that s not right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
yeah it is right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then two six two four four four,False,False,good,,,,,,
two six two four four four four,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s auto format all this,False,False,good,,,,,,
okay now this is the really important part,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i need everything to line up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s not lining up the way i wanted to,True,False,bad,,,,,,
help me line up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no no this plus has to go here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this has to go there,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s ok now,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s fine,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s fine,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok it is fine now,True,False,bad,,,,,,
everything s okay everybody,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh wait no no no,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i need a zero here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
definitely need a zero there,True,False,bad,,,,,,
ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
what s wrong,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh no no,True,False,bad,,,,,,
these have to go over because there is no negative there,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh and this has yeah i do not like this,True,True,good,,,,,,
this has to go over too,False,False,good,,,,,,
yes yes,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok this has to go over,True,False,bad,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok that is much better now,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now the other thing is i m just going to say float next x,True,False,bad,,,,,,
float next y,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i m going to because i just wanted to clear the variables once,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m going to get rid of all of these,True,False,bad,,,,,,
yes you are watching me do this in the most tedious ridiculous way possible,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but it is good this is good for you,True,False,bad,,,,,,
because you are in your frustration and like oh i got a lot,True,True,good,,,,,,
you re going to you are going to improve your coding skills by doing it in a different way,True,False,bad,,,,,,
watching me and my poor poor poor way of doing this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this is good,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now i need to now i m going to pick a random number,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i m just going to say i m going to just do this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if r is less i m going to i m going to do a one out of four chance for each of these,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if r is less than do this,False,False,good,,,,,,
otherwise if r is less than do this one,False,False,good,,,,,,
otherwise otherwise if r is less than do this one,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then otherwise do the last one,False,False,good,,,,,,
so now i m just doing a one out of four chance of doing any of these,True,False,bad,,,,,,
ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let s all right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so let us run this and see what happens,False,False,good,,,,,,
we re not going to get the fern,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but we should get ooh look at this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m getting something,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s just look at this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh it might even be like two,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s just look at this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh it might even be like tree like,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so one thing i want to do is i want to pick the i want to take this which is like sort of like next point,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i m going to put that into its own function next point,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so that i can because i m i m probably going to want to also do this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh and then i m going to take this and draw a point,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then because i might want to do these multiple times in draw,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i think just and i could probably do this in an object oriented way,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i should probably store it in a ray of all the points,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but let us just look at this,False,False,good,,,,,,
so now let s let me let this go a little faster,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let me say do a hundred of these transformations per frame,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we can see and by the way should be at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
i am now sort of figuring out,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i m going to put at the bottom,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i m going to map this from a two two down to,True,False,bad,,,,,,
right,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh whoa i did that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no to i mean,True,False,bad,,,,,,
to,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
so here s my weird tree thing that i m making without being thoughtful about those probabilities,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s go look at the wikipedia page for those probabilities,False,False,good,,,,,,
and you can see they are actually right here in this table,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so this table is actually defining all those coefficients,False,False,good,,,,,,
and here in repeat probability,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we have a chance of the first one chance of the second chance of the third and chance of the fourth,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m actually going to put this i m going to amazingly do this in an array,True,False,bad,,,,,,
well actually so so okay,True,True,good,,,,,,
so there is let us think about this,False,False,good,,,,,,
back here,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s a chance of this first one,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i know that should be this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now i want to have an chance of this second one,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so now i actually need to look and see is it less than,True,False,bad,,,,,,
because if it is less than that is a chance,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and between and is,False,False,good,,,,,,
then i need to do less than right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
because there is a chance of this third one,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and in all other cases the fourth one,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us look at this now,False,False,good,,,,,,
and are we going to get a barnsley firm,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is looking pretty good,False,False,good,,,,,,
now everything s like way off the screen right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
because i was not proud,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i was like oh that ll just make up between negative and,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but you might have noticed remember the jazz timing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
plus,False,False,good,,,,,,
so clearly the point can go further than that,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us give ourselves some more space,False,False,good,,,,,,
so where are the mappings,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the mappings are here,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s go from to,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and let us try negative to,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and let us make the stroke weight a little bit less,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s give ourselves much more space,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh look at that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
beauty us ness,True,False,bad,,,,,,
barnsley firm,False,False,good,,,,,,
that looks about right,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m done,True,False,bad,,,,,,
even though i want to do so much more,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but i m not going to,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m going to let you do more,True,False,bad,,,,,,
because what can you how could you animate this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
how could you pick color,True,False,bad,,,,,,
how could you consider the space,True,False,bad,,,,,,
how could you connect the points,True,False,bad,,,,,,
how could you render this in a different way,True,False,bad,,,,,,
there s so many possibilities,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but i m going to leave this at this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i ve just done the core algorithm,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and we have this barnsley firm,False,False,good,,,,,,
and you know you can by the way you can draw,True,False,bad,,,,,,
you can see here s variations of this,False,False,good,,,,,,
why is mine kind of different than this though,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so first of all i m discovering here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this is actually giving me the correct range,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so let us actually do this range,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s go into the code and implement the range that was on the wikipedia page,False,False,good,,,,,,
so negative,True,False,bad,,,,,,
to there,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then zero to let us try this,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i was not mapping the proper range,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so it did not curve to the right,False,False,good,,,,,,
but now i am mapping the full barnsley firm,True,False,bad,,,,,,
thank you very much,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i really want to make it rainbow color and do other stuff,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but we have completed it,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is the barnsley firm fractal in processing in about three hours and minutes,False,False,good,,,,,,
thanks for watching this entire video,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i hope you make a variation of this in some way that i could not possibly imagine,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and share it with me,False,False,good,,,,,,
share it in the comments,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s a way you can go to the coding and submit a link to your contribution,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and on twitter at shift minarets the coding train,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
thanks,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i will see you all in the next coding challenge,False,False,good,,,,,,
okay hello and welcome to a coding challenge,False,False,good,,,,,,
google chrome dinosaur game edition,False,False,good,,,,,,
unfortunately i do not have my train whistle,False,False,good,,,,,,
i did not bring it with me today,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this is definitely not going to go well,True,False,bad,,,,,,
not that any of my coding challenges ever go well but i m going to give this a try,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m going to attempt to program quickly,False,False,good,,,,,,
the google chrome dinosaur game,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to use my own images and stuff,False,False,good,,,,,,
so it will be the unicorn game of course,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to use p jess the javascript library p jess and i m going to interact with it in a unique way that you have to stick around for the end of the video,False,False,good,,,,,,
i ll just tell you now,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to try to control with my voice,False,False,good,,,,,,
okay so you skip to the end,False,False,good,,,,,,
maybe i ll be doing it there,False,False,good,,,,,,
okay so here we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s get started,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what do i need to do,False,False,good,,,,,,
so first i m going to make a i m going to add i m going to the p web editor,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to add a file,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to call it a dyno js,False,False,good,,,,,,
even though it is not let us call it unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
unicorn js,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is going to be my unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
and what do i need,False,False,good,,,,,,
i also need to have those are like cactus thingies,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i mean those are going to be trains,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to make a train js add file,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us start by creating the unicorn class unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to use object oriented programming because you know i do basically this by the way is exactly the same as slapy bird,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m really just doing the same thing over again but whatever,True,True,good,,,,,,
this is a nice beginner friendly challenge,False,False,good,,,,,,
so and maybe using object oriented programming is a little bit overkill,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but let us give the unicorn a x location at and a y location which will be height because it is sitting at the bottom of the window but maybe i ll say like height minus right now,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i m going to create a function called show and i m going to draw it,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m just going to draw as a rectangle right now at this x this y and i ll make it,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this is the unicorn class,False,False,good,,,,,,
a unicorn object has an x and a y and when i draw it it is a rectangle at that x and a y with a width and height of,False,False,good,,,,,,
and those will probably need to be variables eventually,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let me make a variable called unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to say unicorn is a new unicorn and i m going to say here unicorn show,False,False,good,,,,,,
and let us run this,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
so of course i forgot what i always forget which is that i ve added some new javascript files and i need to reference them in my html,True,False,bad,,,,,,
unicorn and what was the other thing called train,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right,False,False,good,,,,,,
so that is a unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
and what i want is but let me play that game again,False,False,good,,,,,,
how does it work,False,False,good,,,,,,
it just sits there,False,False,good,,,,,,
so every time i press the space bar it jumps,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us get it to do that first,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s get it to do that first,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what does it need in order to be able to jump,False,False,good,,,,,,
it needs a velocity a speed along the y axis,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us call this vy and we will say that is zero,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we will write a function called jump which we will give it kind of this like instant force,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we are going to like push it up,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to say this dot vy equals let us say like negative five,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s moving it up,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i m going to write a function called move which says this dot y plus equals this dot vy,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what we should see now is if i say unicorn dot move and then if i add function key pressed and say if the key is the space bar unicorn dot jump,False,False,good,,,,,,
this really is basically the same as flappy birds so far,False,False,good,,,,,,
then we should see that velocity kick in,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m always moving it based on whatever that velocity is,False,False,good,,,,,,
but the velocity is zero the speed is zero,False,False,good,,,,,,
but as soon as i say jump it sets the speed to negative five and we should start to see it move up,False,False,good,,,,,,
here we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i m moving along here,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to press space,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
ah goodbye unicorn,True,False,bad,,,,,,
see you later,True,False,bad,,,,,,
all right,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we need gravity,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we need some form of gravity which probably makes sense as a global variable but i m just going to since the gravity is really only going to affect the unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to put it in here,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s say it is a zero point five,False,False,good,,,,,,
so gravity is in a way a counteracting force,False,False,good,,,,,,
so no matter what it is doing the gravity is always adjusting the speed of the unicorn the acceleration basically,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what i can do now also in move is say this dot vy plus equal this dot gravity,False,False,good,,,,,,
however i do not want to ever let because now it is gone,False,False,good,,,,,,
i do not want to ever let the unicorn fall off the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
it should be basically a ground level,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to do that,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us make this a size,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s say r equals,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we are going to kind of use that for all the parts where we are drawing,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i m also going to say i m going to have a constraint,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to say this dot y equals constraint,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s current y value between zero and really where it is sitting at the bottom which is also height minus this dot r so it is stuck there,False,False,good,,,,,,
and now if i press oops press space you can see it jumps,False,False,good,,,,,,
now that is a very measly little jump,True,True,good,,,,,,
we need to be able to jump much more,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us set this to like,False,False,good,,,,,,
and let us see what happens,False,False,good,,,,,,
okay,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s too much,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s just set it to,False,False,good,,,,,,
maybe i need to make the gravity stronger too,False,False,good,,,,,,
so there is going to be a lot of fine tuning of this,False,False,good,,,,,,
but let us just do that,False,False,good,,,,,,
and let me set this to,False,False,good,,,,,,
whoops,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and maybe let us set the gravity to two,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
this feels a bit more like the dinosaur game,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this is kind of sad,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s make our unicorn look a little bit more exciting,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s load an image,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i have on the desktop here i have some images,False,False,good,,,,,,
i have a background which will be the background of the game,False,False,good,,,,,,
i have a unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
this will be the character with a little angry equal sign sitting on it,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then the train will be the thing and has to jump over,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let s so what i m going to do here is i m going to add these files,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to add file,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i m going to drag them in to the web editor,False,False,good,,,,,,
it uploaded all of them,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then in here i m going to add preload,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i m going to have let you image let t image and let background image,False,False,good,,,,,,
and let us load all those,False,False,good,,,,,,
u image equals load image unicorn png,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we are doing the same,False,False,good,,,,,,
for t image and background image this is train,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this is background,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s change the background to ooh,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what did i get wrong here,False,False,good,,,,,,
background is actually a jpeg,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us have the background now be background image,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
and let us have the unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
where is it be,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to say image unicorn image,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s so tiny,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh it is not pixelated,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s so sad,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s change this to,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s but it is x value should not be here,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
so there is our jumping unicorn,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this is not a lot of screen real estate to work with,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let me actually load a background image that is pixels wide which i think will be a little better than,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right my unicorn can jump,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i ve made the background a little wider which means now i need obstacles for it to jump over,False,False,good,,,,,,
and those are going to be little train things,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to make another class call it a train,False,True,bad,,,,,,
choo choo,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m going to give that a constructor,False,False,good,,,,,,
these will have also an x and a y,False,False,good,,,,,,
so the x will be it is going to start off the edge,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the y will be actually also at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
so height minus i ll give it a size,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this dot r will be,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then so now i need a show function,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that i m going to draw as an image like fingers are in the wrong place the train image at x and y,False,False,good,,,,,,
this dot r this dot r and let us also add a move function,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we will say this dot x minus equals,False,False,good,,,,,,
and so the train so this is a weird thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s supposed to be oh this is going to be a problem,False,False,good,,,,,,
my fixed background is going to make this visually a problem,False,False,good,,,,,,
and people on the chat are saying parallax background please,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right so maybe i m going to get to that,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is going to end up being a longer video if i implement that,False,False,good,,,,,,
but really the unicorn is moving,False,False,good,,,,,,
so the unicorn is moving but the x stays fixed,False,False,good,,,,,,
the trains well the trains could be moving if they are trains,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that s weird,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but they are supposed to be cactuses cacti,True,False,bad,,,,,,
they re standing still and the unicorn is just approaching them,False,False,good,,,,,,
but we are seeing it from the unicorns point of view,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh i ve really botched this,False,True,bad,,,,,,
but what i m going to do is just move them by the whole scene is scrolling by three pixels,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we will figure out if we can parallax the background maybe later,False,False,good,,,,,,
what do i even mean by parallax to make it appear as if the background is changing but often the distance so it is sort of moving at a different speed,False,False,good,,,,,,
but for now let us just do this,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s create an array called trains,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we are going to say train in setup,False,False,good,,,,,,
well actually you know what we are going to do in draw,False,False,good,,,,,,
we re just going to randomly,False,False,good,,,,,,
we re going to pick a random number between and,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we will say of the time we are going to say trains push,False,False,good,,,,,,
we re going to add a new train,False,False,good,,,,,,
so it is going to be irregular,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is different than the flappy bird i made where the i think the pipes maybe it was a regular,False,False,good,,,,,,
i thought the pipes were regular intervals,False,False,good,,,,,,
now there is a random chance of adding a new train,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then all of the trains that exist we are going to say four all of the train the dodged say t in trains,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to say t dot move t dot show,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right let us see what happens,False,False,good,,,,,,
do we have a train,False,False,good,,,,,,
maybe i better increase this,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh look at that,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right they are moving,False,False,good,,,,,,
they re kind of slow,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to jump over it,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok let us make them move a little faster,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we have got some tweaking we have got to do,False,False,good,,,,,,
whoa this is a nice way,True,True,good,,,,,,
now look my unicorn can fly,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i need to fix the fact i need to not allow my unicorn to fly right,True,True,good,,,,,,
i should only be able to jump if i m at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us fix that,False,False,good,,,,,,
so to do that i need to go into unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
and in the jump function i should only be allowed to jump if i m sitting at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
so in other words if y is oh well if i m at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
so as long as y is equal to is this really going to work,False,False,good,,,,,,
i do not like to use equal checks,False,False,good,,,,,,
but this is by definition sitting at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
so only if i m sitting at the bottom can i jump,False,False,good,,,,,,
so if y is equal to that spot let us see if that works,False,False,good,,,,,,
so jump oops jump,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh this dot y,False,False,good,,,,,,
come on trains,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh yeah yep i can only jump when i m at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right so that works,False,False,good,,,,,,
so that fixed,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think i need to be able to jump quite a bit higher,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s try,False,False,good,,,,,,
should really use like a slider or something,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think this is going to make the game more possible to win,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s too many trains,True,False,bad,,,,,,
too many trains,True,False,bad,,,,,,
one thing that is bothering me is the trains are going in front of the unicorn,False,False,good,,,,,,
i know that does not really matter,False,False,good,,,,,,
so much,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s really does not matter,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i kind of would prefer them to be behind,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to move this here,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m also going to make the game a little easier to play,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to reduce the number of trains,False,False,good,,,,,,
so there is going to be a much lower probability of there being a train,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s see if i can actually play this game somewhat successfully even though i m not doing the collision checking yet,False,False,good,,,,,,
no,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think if the trains move faster it would actually make it easier,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us actually double the speed of the trains,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right,False,False,good,,,,,,
this looks like this game is now possible to play,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i need to add collision detection,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i ve done this before in plenty of other coding challenges,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s a pretty simple algorithm to just check if two rectangles are intersecting with each other or not,False,False,good,,,,,,
i can just check their x s and y,False,False,good,,,,,,
they re basically all of the edges the left the right the top the bottom against each other,False,False,good,,,,,,
but this is a nice opportunity for me to just explore a library that is out there in the world,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this library is called p collide d,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it actually has a function that it called collide rectangle rectangle,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it will give me a boolean variable if i give it the x y with height of one rectangle and the x y with height of another rectangle,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us actually just use this library,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is also a nice excuse for me to show you that github is now integrated with something called jsdeliver,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this is an open source content delivery network meaning if a javascript file is hosted on github i do not have to download that file and then add it to my project,False,False,good,,,,,,
i can just link to it,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to go over here to github,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s lots of different ways here that i can reference a file on github,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think the easiest way for what i m doing right now is just to reference its path,False,False,good,,,,,,
and here s an example path,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to go over here to index html,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to add another script tag,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to say script source equals,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to paste that in closed script,False,False,good,,,,,,
but this is not the path that i want,False,False,good,,,,,,
i want the username which is b m o r e n and then i want the path to let us get the minified version of the library,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that would just be this right there in the root directory,False,False,good,,,,,,
so now i m just referencing that file,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s see if that works,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is actually not correct,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m referencing the cdn url the username but i also need the repo name,False,False,good,,,,,,
so that should be p collide d slash this,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this should now work,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i should be able to use the collide function,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to use this collide rectangle rectangle,False,False,good,,,,,,
let me just call this in draw to see if that works,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it does not give me an error,False,False,good,,,,,,
great,True,True,good,,,,,,
no error,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and so now i can check when i m going through all of the trains if unicorn hits t console log game over,False,False,good,,,,,,
so console log game over,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i m actually going to say no loop,False,True,bad,,,,,,
so i m just going to actually stop the sketch shut down the sketch completely which is not a really thoughtful user experience design choice,False,False,good,,,,,,
but it is what i m going to do for right now,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i just need to add a function here called hits and receives a train,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i can use this function which i need this x this y this r this r,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i need exactly the same thing but with that particular train,False,False,good,,,,,,
so instead of this i m checking this rectangle with this trains rectangle,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i m going to put this in a variable called collide,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i m going to say if i am going to return that,False,False,good,,,,,,
i can actually you know what,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m just returning this,False,False,good,,,,,,
return that,False,False,good,,,,,,
so return the true or false result of this collide function from that library,False,False,good,,,,,,
and now let us run the game,False,False,good,,,,,,
i ll wait for our first train,False,False,good,,,,,,
game over,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s see if i can play it now,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh there are so many trains oh well you are hooked,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s make the train a little bit smaller,False,False,good,,,,,,
and actually let us make the unicorn smaller as well,False,False,good,,,,,,
hopefully this will help,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right let us draw the box,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s debug this a little bit by drawing the box like very subtly,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us draw a very slight rectangle,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is what we are actually checking,False,False,good,,,,,,
there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
it helps to see the full box,False,False,good,,,,,,
come on trains,False,False,good,,,,,,
spawning a train with a mouse click would be a good idea,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok we lost,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right so there is obviously a lot of gameplay improvements that need to happen here,False,False,good,,,,,,
one is i could be more thoughtful about you can see how there is some wasted space here,False,False,good,,,,,,
i should crop the image and the actual rectangle a little bit smaller,False,False,good,,,,,,
i could consider using a circle,False,False,good,,,,,,
i could use a more complex shape,False,False,good,,,,,,
but this is good enough for right now,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s actually make it,False,False,good,,,,,,
i could also just click the mouse in order to start a train that actually might help things,False,False,good,,,,,,
but let me comment out this,False,False,good,,,,,,
and what i want to do just before i go before i finish saying you are going to make a version of this with a score and all sorts of nicer things and sounds,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i ve got to finish this off,False,False,good,,,,,,
i ve got to finish this video,False,False,good,,,,,,
i want to control the train with my voice,False,False,good,,,,,,
so to do that i m going to use ml js which has a speech commands machine learning model built into this javascript library,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i made a whole separate video about this particular pre trained model and how it works,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m just going to add it pretty quickly into this video,False,False,good,,,,,,
you can go watch the other one for more details,False,False,good,,,,,,
but if you are looking for the documentation if i click on reference and go to sound classifier this is what i m looking at doing,False,False,good,,,,,,
so all i need to first thing i need to do is well actually one thing i need to do is i need to go to get started,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i need to get a script tag to be able to reference the library,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i want to add the ml library,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m copying this,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going here to index the html,False,False,good,,,,,,
so in addition to p cly d i m now adding ml,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i m going to go here,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i m going to in preload,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to do let sound classifier create a variable in preload,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to say sound classifier equals ml sound classifier,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the model i m loading is called speech commands w,False,False,good,,,,,,
because this is a model that is been trained to recognize particular words,False,False,good,,,,,,
zero the digits zero through nine up down left right and a few other ones that are documented on this ml webpage,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s go look that up real quick,False,False,good,,,,,,
so if i go back to sound classifier up down left right go stop yes no,False,False,good,,,,,,
so those are the words it is trained to recognize,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i actually also want to get this probability threshold,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to add this in here because i want it to be really sure i m saying jump,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to make this,False,False,good,,,,,,
this means it is got to be sure,False,False,good,,,,,,
the confidence score that is coming from that particular model,False,False,good,,,,,,
and how that model was trained and there is all the paper you can read,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i ve talked about that more in the other video,False,False,good,,,,,,
so now that i have that in setup i can say sound classifier classify then i can get a function,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to call it got word,False,False,good,,,,,,
we re got command,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s call it got command,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this is a callback function that is going to trigger any time it gets a command,False,False,good,,,,,,
it gets an error first error first callbacks and then the results,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m just going to say if there is an error i m just going to console error the error,False,False,good,,,,,,
otherwise if results index dot label,False,False,good,,,,,,
so results as an array with labels and confidence scores,False,False,good,,,,,,
the labels are the words,False,False,good,,,,,,
and what i m looking for is the word up,False,False,good,,,,,,
if that label is up then unicorn jump,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this is a really quick way of me looking for a particular keyword from that library,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i m also just going to console log results index dot label,False,False,good,,,,,,
just to see if i m getting other words also,False,True,bad,,,,,,
and we might as well log the confidence score just so we can see that,False,False,good,,,,,,
that might be good for debugging as well,False,False,good,,,,,,
so now that i ve logged those two things i m going to run this sketch,False,False,good,,,,,,
shoot,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but you can see it got up,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to add the thing where i click the mouse and i can give myself a train,False,False,good,,,,,,
and in fact let us comment out the random trains,False,False,good,,,,,,
also i really should be more thoughtful about how i m picking the train,False,False,good,,,,,,
like when the train should come like maybe there is a minimum distance between them,False,False,good,,,,,,
if i ve just added one can i have a longer train with other train cars,False,False,good,,,,,,
i do not know what is going on here,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s a lot of narrative flaws in what is going on here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but i m just going to add one myself,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,False,False,good,,,,,,
yes,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,False,False,good,,,,,,
shoot,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right,False,False,good,,,,,,
everyone is making the suggestion in the chat that i should change it to a circle,False,False,good,,,,,,
so that ll actually kind of be like around it,False,False,good,,,,,,
it ll give me a little wiggle room along the edges and make the intersection happen a little less often,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us actually go ahead and do that,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to go into where the only place where i m doing this collision detection is where in the unicorn under hits,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to change this to collide circle circle collide circle circle and circle to circle assumes ellipse mode center,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m going to have to think of the circle as the center point of the object which is not a big deal,False,False,good,,,,,,
so the way that i m going to do that let us make some separate variables,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s say x equals this dot x plus this dot r times,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this would be the middle,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is the middle,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then r is the diameter of the circle,False,False,good,,,,,,
so that is fine,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is y,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then x y is the train,False,False,good,,,,,,
train dot x train dot y train dot r train dot r and so now i want collide circle circle x y and then x y,False,False,good,,,,,,
the question is is r for actually the radius or is it the diameter,False,False,good,,,,,,
does it say circle diameter circle diameter,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i m good,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right so let us try this,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then this should really be oh this is kind of unfortunate,False,False,good,,,,,,
this should now be an ellipse,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh you know what i can just do,False,False,good,,,,,,
i can say ellipse mode corner perfect,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us draw the hit circles under train,False,False,good,,,,,,
let s do the same thing here and say ellipse there,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this should now we should see,False,False,good,,,,,,
here we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s what it is going to do,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok here we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh after click,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh what happened,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right i passed r in twice which is very unnecessary,False,True,bad,,,,,,
you just give it the diameter not the radius even though i m calling it r once,False,False,good,,,,,,
and let us see what happens,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok here we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
jump,False,False,good,,,,,,
why is my browser really freaking out,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let s comment out the debugging,False,False,good,,,,,,
we re just going to go for it now,False,False,good,,,,,,
we re going to play this game and close this tab,False,False,good,,,,,,
quick chrome,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we re about to play this game,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i m saying jump,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
yeah there we go,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
all right ready everyone,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
look at me,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i guess i cannot use the music,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
ah,True,False,bad,,,,,,
all right everyone,False,False,good,,,,,,
thus ends this coding challenge,False,False,good,,,,,,
there are so many things that need to be added to this,False,False,good,,,,,,
number one the narrative is makes no sense,False,False,good,,,,,,
why is there this unicorn standing still,False,False,good,,,,,,
without any animation,False,False,good,,,,,,
the trains are coming at it,False,False,good,,,,,,
the background should be sort of like in parallax moving,False,False,good,,,,,,
so probably it should be jumping over,False,False,good,,,,,,
i should have just used cacti,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s the plural of cactus right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
there s no score,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s no birds flying,False,False,good,,,,,,
you could add a flying asterisk,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to when i upload this i m going to include when i when this video publishes and with the code i will include a lot of the coding train characters which are designed by jason heggland so i m going to include a whole bunch of those,False,False,good,,,,,,
if people want to make a version of this game that we can all play online with speech commands,False,False,good,,,,,,
let me try this,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m going to just say goodbye by trying this one more sentence,False,False,good,,,,,,
yes alka is pointing out that speech detection i behind the browser might be lower latency but let us try this one more time,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,False,False,good,,,,,,
up,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh okay,False,False,good,,,,,,
goodbye everyone,False,False,good,,,,,,
thank you very much,False,False,good,,,,,,
and see you later on a future coding challenge,False,False,good,,,,,,
how are you,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s been great is not it,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s been blown away by the whole thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
in fact i m leaving,True,False,bad,,,,,,
there were three themes running through the conference and i m going to talk about one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we have had and in all the people here,False,False,good,,,,,,
just the variety of it and the range of it,False,False,good,,,,,,
the second is that it is put us in a place where we have no idea what is going to happen in terms of the future,False,False,good,,,,,,
no idea how this may play out,False,False,good,,,,,,
i have an interest in education,False,False,good,,,,,,
actually what i find is everybody has an interest in education,False,False,good,,,,,,
i find this very interesting,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you do that at a dinner party and you say you work in education actually you are not often at dinner parties frankly if you work in education you are not asked and you will never ask back curiously,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but if you are and you say to somebody what do you do and you say you work in education you can see the blood run from their face they re like oh my god why me my one night out all week,True,True,good,,,,,,
but if you ask their education they pin you to the wall because it is one of those things that goes deep with people am i right religion and money,False,False,good,,,,,,
i have a big interest in education i think we all do,False,False,good,,,,,,
we have a huge vested interest in it partly because it is education that is meant to take us into this future that we cannot grasp if you think of it children starting school this year will be retiring in nobody has a clue,False,True,bad,,,,,,
despite all the expertise that is been on parade for the past four days what the world will look like in five years time and yet we are meant to be educating them for it so the unpredictability i think is extraordinary,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the third part of this is that we have all agreed nonetheless on the really extraordinary capacities that children have their capacities for innovation,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean serena last night was a marvel wasn t she just seeing what you could do and she is exceptional but i think she is not so to speak exceptional in the whole of childhood,False,False,good,,,,,,
and you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent,False,False,good,,,,,,
and my contention is all kids have tremendous talents and we squander them pretty ruthlessly,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i want to talk about education and i want to talk about creativity my contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy and we should treat it with the same status,False,False,good,,,,,,
thank you that was it thank you very much,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so minutes left,True,False,bad,,,,,,
well i was born,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no the,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i had a great story recently,False,False,good,,,,,,
i love telling it,False,False,good,,,,,,
i have a little girl who was in a drawing lesson she was six and she was at the back drawing and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention and in this drawing lesson she did and the teacher was fascinated she went over to and she said what are you drawing and the girl said i m drawing a picture of god and the teacher said but nobody knows what god looks like and the girl said they will in a minute,True,False,bad,,,,,,
okay,False,False,good,,,,,,
when,False,False,good,,,,,,
when my son was four in england actually he was four everywhere to be honest i mean for being strict about it wherever he went he was four out here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but he was in the nativity play,False,False,good,,,,,,
do you remember the story,False,False,good,,,,,,
no it was big,False,False,good,,,,,,
it was big story,False,False,good,,,,,,
mel gibson at the sequel you may have seen it,False,False,good,,,,,,
nativity too,False,False,good,,,,,,
james got the part of joseph which we were thrilled about we consider this to be one of the lead parts,False,False,good,,,,,,
we had the place crammed full of agents in t shirts,False,False,good,,,,,,
james robinson is joseph,False,False,good,,,,,,
he did not have to speak,False,False,good,,,,,,
but you know where the three kings come in they come in bearing gifts and they bring gold frankincense and meh,False,False,good,,,,,,
this really happened,False,False,good,,,,,,
we re sitting there,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think just went out of sequence,False,False,good,,,,,,
because we talked to little boy afterwards and said you know you are okay with that,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they said yeah why was that wrong,False,False,good,,,,,,
they just switched,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think it was it,False,False,good,,,,,,
anyway the three boys came in little four year olds with two towns on their heads and they put these boxes down i bring you gold and the second boy said i bring you mayor and the third boy said frank sent this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
well these things having in common is that kids will take a chance you know if they do not know they will have a go am i right,False,False,good,,,,,,
they re not frightened of being wrong now i do not mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative what we do know is if you are not prepared to be wrong you will never come up with anything original if you are not prepared to be wrong,False,False,good,,,,,,
and by the time they get to be adults most kids have lost that capacity they have become frightened of being wrong,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we run our companies this by the way,False,False,good,,,,,,
we stigmatize mistakes,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we are now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities,False,False,good,,,,,,
picasso once said this he said that all children are born artists the problem is to remain an artist as we grow up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i believe this passionately that we do not grow into creativity we grow out of it or rather we get educated out of it so why is this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i lived in stratford on avon until about five years ago we moved from stratford to los angeles so you can imagine what a seamless transition you know this was from,True,False,bad,,,,,,
actually we lived in a place called sinisterfield just outside stratford which is where shakespeare s father was born,False,False,good,,,,,,
are you struck by a new thought i was,False,False,good,,,,,,
you do not think of shakespeare having a father do you do you,True,False,bad,,,,,,
because you do not think of shakespeare being a child shakespeare being seven i never thought of it i mean he was a seven at some point he was in somebody s english class was not he,True,False,bad,,,,,,
being sent to bed by his dad to shakespeare go to bed now to william shakespeare and put the pencil down and stop speaking like that it s confusing everybody,True,False,bad,,,,,,
anyway we moved from stratford to los angeles and i just want to say a word about the transition actually my son did not want to come,False,True,bad,,,,,,
i ve got two kids he is now my daughter s,False,False,good,,,,,,
he did not want to come to los angeles,False,False,good,,,,,,
he loved it but he had a girlfriend in england this was the love of his life sarah he d known her for a month,True,False,bad,,,,,,
mind you they would had their fourth anniversary because it is a long time when you are,False,True,bad,,,,,,
he was really upset on the plane he said i ll never find another girl like sarah and we were rather pleased about that frankly because she was the main reason we were leaving the country,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but something strikes you when you move to america and travel around the world every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects every one doesn t matter where you go you d think it would be otherwise but it isn t at the top are mathematics and languages then the humanities at the bottom are the arts everywhere on earth,False,False,good,,,,,,
and in pretty much every system too there is a hierarchy within the arts art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance,False,False,good,,,,,,
there is not an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics why why not,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think this is rather important,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think math is very important but so is dance,False,False,good,,,,,,
children dance all the time if they are allowed to we all do,False,False,good,,,,,,
we all have bodies do not we did i miss a meeting,True,False,bad,,,,,,
truthfully what happens is as children grow up we start to educate them progressively from the waist up and then we focus on their heads and slightly to one side,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you were to visit education as an alien and say what s it for public education,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think you would have to conclude if you look at the output who really succeeds by this who does everything they should who gets all the brownie points who are the winners i think you would have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors isn t it,False,False,good,,,,,,
they re the people who come out the top and i used to be one so there,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i like university professors but you know we should not hold them up as the high water mark of all human achievement they re just a form of life another form of life,False,False,good,,,,,,
but they are rather curious,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i say this out of affection for them there is something curious about professors in my experience not all of them but typically they live in their heads,False,False,good,,,,,,
they live up there and slightly to one side they re disembodied you know in a kind of literal way they look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads,True,False,bad,,,,,,
don t they,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s a way of getting their head to meetings,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if you want real evidence of out of body experiences by the way get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and there you will see it,False,False,good,,,,,,
grown men and women writhing uncontrollably off the beat waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability and there is a reason,False,False,good,,,,,,
around the world there were no public systems of education really before the th century they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism,False,False,good,,,,,,
so the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas number one that the most useful subjects for work are at the top,False,False,good,,,,,,
so you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid things you liked on the grounds you would never get a job doing that,False,False,good,,,,,,
is that right,False,False,good,,,,,,
don t do music you are not going to be a musician do not do art you will not be an artist,False,False,good,,,,,,
benign advice now profoundly mistaken,False,True,bad,,,,,,
the whole world is engulfed in a revolution,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the second is academic ability which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence because the universities design the system in their image,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you think of it the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the consequence is that many highly talented brilliant creative people think they are not because the thing they were good at at school was not valued or was actually stigmatized,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i think we cannot afford to go on that way,False,False,good,,,,,,
in the next years according to unesco more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history more people,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it is the combination of all the things we have talked about technology and its transformational effect on work and demography and the huge explosion in population,False,False,good,,,,,,
suddenly degrees are not worth anything isn t that true,False,False,good,,,,,,
when i was a student if you had a degree you had a job if you did not have a job it is because you did not want one and i did not want one frankly,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games because you need an ma where the previous job required a ba and now you need a phd for the other,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s a process of academic inflation,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet,False,False,good,,,,,,
we need to radically rethink our view of intelligence,False,False,good,,,,,,
we know three things about intelligence,False,False,good,,,,,,
one it is diverse we think about the world in all the ways that we experience it we think visually we think in sound we think kinesthetically we think in abstract terms we think in movement,False,False,good,,,,,,
secondly intelligence is dynamic if you look at the interactions of a human brain as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations intelligence is wonderfully interactive the brain is not divided into compartments,False,False,good,,,,,,
in fact creativity which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things,False,False,good,,,,,,
by the way there is a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum it s thicker in women following off from helen yesterday this is probably why women are better at multitasking because you are are not you,False,True,bad,,,,,,
there s a raft of research but i know it from my personal life if my wife is cooking a meal at home which is not often thankfully,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no she is good at some things,False,False,good,,,,,,
but if she is cooking she is dealing with people on the phone she is talking to the kids she is painting the ceiling she is doing open heart surgery over here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if i m cooking the door is shut the kids are out the phone s on the hook if she comes in i get annoyed i say terry please i m trying to fry an egg in here give me a break,True,False,bad,,,,,,
actually do you know that old philosophical thing if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it did it happen,False,False,good,,,,,,
remember that old chestnut,False,False,good,,,,,,
i saw a great t shirt recently which said if a man speaks his mind in a forest and no woman hears him is he still wrong,True,True,good,,,,,,
and the third thing about intelligence is it is distinct,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m doing a new book at the moment called epiphany which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m fascinated by how people got to be there,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s really prompted by a conversation i had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of gillian lynne have you heard of her some have,False,False,good,,,,,,
she s a choreographer and everybody knows her work she did cats and phantom of the opera she s wonderful,False,False,good,,,,,,
i used to be on the board of the royal ballet as you can see,True,False,bad,,,,,,
gillian and i had lunch one day i said how did you get to be a dancer,False,False,good,,,,,,
it was interesting when she was at school she was really hopeless and the school in the s wrote to her parents and said we think gillian has a learning disorder she could not concentrate she was fidgeting,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think now they would say she had adhd wouldn t you,False,False,good,,,,,,
but this was the s and adhd had not been invented at this point it was not an available condition,True,False,bad,,,,,,
people were not aware they could have that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
anyway she went to see this specialist so this oak paneled room and she was there with her mother and she was led and sat on this chair at the end and she sat on her hands for minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems gillian was having at school because she was disturbing people her homework was always late and so on little kid of eight in the end the doctor went and sat next to gillian and said i ve listened to all these things your mother s told me i need to speak to her privately wait here we ll be back we will not be very long and they went and left her,False,False,good,,,,,,
but as they went out of the room he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk and when they got out of the room he said to her mother just stand and watch her and the minute they left the room she was on her feet moving to the music and they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said mrs lynne gillian is not sick she s a dancer take her to a dance school,False,False,good,,,,,,
i said what happened she said she did i cannot tell you how wonderful it was we walked in this room and it was full of people like me people who could not sit still people who had to move to think who had to move to think,False,False,good,,,,,,
they did ballet they did tap jazz they did modern they did contemporary,False,False,good,,,,,,
she was eventually auditioned for the royal ballet school,False,False,good,,,,,,
she became a soloist she had a wonderful career at the royal ballet,False,False,good,,,,,,
she eventually graduated from the royal ballet school founded the gillian lynne dance company met andrew lloyd webber,False,False,good,,,,,,
she s been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history she is given pleasure to millions and she is a multimillionaire,False,False,good,,,,,,
somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down,False,False,good,,,,,,
what i think it comes to is this al gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by rachel carson,False,False,good,,,,,,
i believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity,False,False,good,,,,,,
our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip mine the earth for a particular commodity and for the future it will not serve us,False,False,good,,,,,,
we have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we are educating our children,False,False,good,,,,,,
there was a wonderful quote by jonas salk who said if all the insects were to disappear from the earth within years all life on earth would end if all human beings disappeared from the earth within years all forms of life would flourish and he is right,False,False,good,,,,,,
what ted celebrates is the gift of the human imagination,False,False,good,,,,,,
we have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we have talked about and the only way we will do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are and our task is to educate their whole being so they can face this future,False,False,good,,,,,,
by the way we may not see this future but they will and our job is to help them make something of it,False,False,good,,,,,,
thank you very much,False,False,good,,,,,,
this right here is the common hippopotamus hippopotamus amphibious,False,False,good,,,,,,
now for a long time it was assumed that the hippopotamus was related to the pig,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean just look at it,False,False,good,,,,,,
but recently they figured out that their closest relatives are the cetaceans,False,False,good,,,,,,
the friggin whales and dolphins,True,False,bad,,,,,,
not the manatee now that would have made too much sense,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i mean a manatee looks like you made a hippo with build a bear but came up short on stuffing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now the manatee is related to the elephant,False,False,good,,,,,,
while the hippo is a whale that wasn t,True,False,bad,,,,,,
anyway the ancestors of the hippos did not join the ancestors of the whales in the ocean,False,False,good,,,,,,
i have a guess why,False,False,good,,,,,,
they did not know how to swim,False,False,good,,,,,,
so they stayed in the kitty pool,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and you know what,False,False,good,,,,,,
million years later they still do not know how to friggin swim,True,False,bad,,,,,,
they really don t they fake it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
they bounce along the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it is kind of cute,True,True,good,,,,,,
look they tuck in their little restangled things like a bunny rabbit,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i mean for not knowing how to swim they are quite graceful,True,False,bad,,,,,,
in part it is because they are sort of a perfect mixture of heavy and buoyant,False,False,good,,,,,,
they re heavy because they have these ultra dense bones,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is good because without them they would have some buoyancy stability problems,False,False,good,,,,,,
but with all that fat in those big lungs they would roll around like a meat beach ball down there,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but as it is it is almost perfect like they are walking on the moon,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but the hippo is not fully aquatic it is semi aquatic which means it does it half ass literally,True,False,bad,,,,,,
their face took a page from the crocodile and sort of rotated their eyes and nose up to the top,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this allows the hippo to hang out in the water looking like a creepy old man in a public pool,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now being semi aquatic all this equipment has to work above and below,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i ll tell you you do not want to play guess that orifice with a hippo,True,True,good,,,,,,
here look at this one,False,False,good,,,,,,
you guess and then i ll show you what happens when it opens up,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh look it is just an eye,False,False,good,,,,,,
under the water they can keep their peepers open because they are protected by a transparent membrane,False,False,good,,,,,,
their nostrils look a bit like two hairy mud slugs singing opera,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i know what you are thinking,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s a hole you could lose a fist in how they keep the water out,False,False,good,,,,,,
where the trick is when they are relaxed they are closed,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is similar to the dolphins blowhole which is just a pair of nostrils that joined up and went to the top,False,False,good,,,,,,
so every time they want to take a breath they have to flare their nostrils,False,False,good,,,,,,
is it just me here does that look like an evil muppet,True,True,good,,,,,,
the good thing is it helps keep the water out,False,False,good,,,,,,
sure once in a while you have to clear out the pipes but these remarkable nostrils allow the hippo to do something else,False,False,good,,,,,,
they can take their nap time under the water,False,False,good,,,,,,
look at that that is how you nap,False,False,good,,,,,,
they ever reflex which allows them to raise their head and take breaths all without waking up,False,False,good,,,,,,
now their ears do this little thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
i like to pretend that they are tiny wings and sometimes it is this little twirly motion,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but this is something they do to get the water out their ears when they come up,False,False,good,,,,,,
and you got to keep those clear because there is a lot to listen for,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it is not just the sounds they make out of the water,False,False,good,,,,,,
some of science hippies threw some carrots into murky water and then listened as a science hippo tried to find them,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the hippo made a series of clicks under the water sounded like this,False,False,good,,,,,,
i know what you are thinking that is a fart,True,True,good,,,,,,
they recorded a hippo fart and that would be embarrassing but no i think they ruled that out,True,True,good,,,,,,
but hippos seem to use clicks to echo locate like the dolphin do and they sound like farts,False,False,good,,,,,,
science,False,False,good,,,,,,
if the hippo is semi aquatic that means that it is also semi land dick during that summer word,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now it is not land dick,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s not aqua dick jerry it is aquatic but if an hippo spend time on land it is,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now you would think that they would live in a place that was wet out of the water like seattle or london,False,False,good,,,,,,
but no they live in the hottest shit places and that can be problematic in a couple of ways,True,False,bad,,,,,,
first of all the pools dry out and then what are you,True,False,bad,,,,,,
semi mud dick,True,False,bad,,,,,,
jerry i did that for you,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but secondly in the heat they have to keep that giant meat potato from overheating,True,False,bad,,,,,,
they do not have sweat glands but they do look a bit sweaty do not they,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s because their skins are creaks amicus,False,False,good,,,,,,
the amicus has a reddish pigment in it called hypo sideric acid which turns brown as it dries out,False,False,good,,,,,,
this compound acts as a sunscreen but also can fight infection from microorganisms and it is another reason why you do not want to ride a hippo naked,True,False,bad,,,,,,
curiosity stream is pretty amazing,False,False,good,,,,,,
i should know because i m a subscriber and i think you should be one too,False,True,bad,,,,,,
listen after all that shorty short form pickles your brain you need to bathe in some nourishing long form content,False,False,good,,,,,,
you know get your head right again,False,False,good,,,,,,
curiosity stream is packed with thousands of smart and entertaining programs about science,False,False,good,,,,,,
history art true crime nature you know i like nature,False,False,good,,,,,,
look at all that nature but you did not even know there was that much nature,False,False,good,,,,,,
i ve been enjoying the series ancient yellowstone,False,False,good,,,,,,
it gets into some of the things you missed on that class trip,False,False,good,,,,,,
look at the geyser look at the geyser,False,False,good,,,,,,
you know that is all you want do your diet coke and mentos,False,False,good,,,,,,
now this is a deep dive,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s these crazy ancient microorganisms that live in those lava lamp things,False,False,good,,,,,,
and there is a big petrified forest up in there,False,False,good,,,,,,
who knew,False,False,good,,,,,,
you do,False,False,good,,,,,,
now,False,False,good,,,,,,
curiosity stream has been a long time sponsor of this program,False,False,good,,,,,,
you know why,False,False,good,,,,,,
because it is great value for great content,False,False,good,,,,,,
check it out,False,False,good,,,,,,
go to slash zfrank,False,False,good,,,,,,
because that is how old i am,False,False,good,,,,,,
use code zfrank to get off when you sign up,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that makes a great deal even better,False,False,good,,,,,,
try it today,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m a fan and happy to have them as a sponsor,False,False,good,,,,,,
where were we,False,False,good,,,,,,
oh right,False,False,good,,,,,,
for the most part hippos eat grasses and shrubbery,False,False,good,,,,,,
mostly at night but that footage sucks,False,True,bad,,,,,,
they sort of use their lips to get at it,False,False,good,,,,,,
all that hardware up front is for fighting not eating,False,True,bad,,,,,,
to chew they got to take it all the way back to where the little teeth are,False,False,good,,,,,,
these grasses are not that nutritious and they are hard to digest,False,False,good,,,,,,
so bacteria in the hippo s stomach ferment and break down those lawn clippings into something that the hippo can work with,False,False,good,,,,,,
after all that is been taken care of of course it comes out the other end,False,False,good,,,,,,
spectacularly,False,False,good,,,,,,
the hippo is not a modest pooper,True,False,bad,,,,,,
not like a dog sort of looking around guiltily,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it looks like a malfunctioning dodo toilet,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the bedenhozzles on full blast,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the thought is this is for scent marking because it helps disperse the scent,False,False,good,,,,,,
understatement,False,True,bad,,,,,,
but here s the thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
hours a day or so they are sitting in a pool with a whole bunch of other hippos,False,False,good,,,,,,
you re shifting around a bit you do not always know what part of the hippo in front of you you are facing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and at some point someone s gonna have to go and it is a pain in the ass to get out get your flip flops,True,False,bad,,,,,,
because the floor in the pool house toilet is always wet and you do not know from what,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so if someone shits in the pool you could make a big deal out of it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
or you could lean into it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and that is what the hippos did,False,False,good,,,,,,
make some lemonade out of those lemons,False,False,good,,,,,,
and by lemonade i mean shits soup,True,True,good,,,,,,
and by shits soup i mean shits soup with benefits,True,True,good,,,,,,
alright that sounds weird,True,False,bad,,,,,,
with all the hippos pooping in the pool that is good news for all the things that like to eat poop,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but as those creatures thrive they take oxygen out of the water,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this in turn makes the water resemble the insides of the hippos gut,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and that means that those healthy bacteria that are living in the gut can come out and play,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and suddenly the water s like a big shared gut,True,False,bad,,,,,,
everyone s pooping in it and drinking it and officiating it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i mean it is good bacteria for everyone,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s like swimming in kombucha,True,False,bad,,,,,,
or a compupcha,True,False,bad,,,,,,
get it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
kill me,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and this can change entire ecosystems,False,False,good,,,,,,
the grass is hippozee er rich in silica,False,False,good,,,,,,
the silica gets used by diatoms,False,False,good,,,,,,
a kind of algae that encases itself in little glass houses,False,False,good,,,,,,
the diatoms can then out compete green algae,False,False,good,,,,,,
which is good because green algae blooms can choke out all the sunlight in the body of water,False,False,good,,,,,,
you want a nice healthy lake,False,False,good,,,,,,
have a hippo shit in it,True,True,good,,,,,,
who knew,False,False,good,,,,,,
but do not start thinking that hippos are just a group of mellow environmentalist river pooping hippies,True,True,good,,,,,,
they ve got some spunk to we do not use that word jerry,True,True,good,,,,,,
they ve got some attitude,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean look at this one,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s chasing a freaking boat,False,False,good,,,,,,
they can gallop underwater,False,False,good,,,,,,
and look it is got a bigger wake than the boat,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean they are not bad on land either,False,False,good,,,,,,
those dense bones they have can support all that weight even in a sprint,False,False,good,,,,,,
and in short stretches they can go miles an hour,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean look at that thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
coming at you and that is a guaranteed pant load,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now being a mucus covered giant bulldozer gives you some protection,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but they also have a weaponized face,False,False,good,,,,,,
you know when somebody yawns and then like you have to yawn,False,False,good,,,,,,
imagine what it is like for the hippos because their yawn goes on for days,True,True,good,,,,,,
this mouth wide open gesture exposes their canine teeth which can be over two feet long,False,False,good,,,,,,
they never stop growing and they self sharpen by rubbing against each other,False,False,good,,,,,,
when you put all that together and you have a creature that really does not give a fuck look at this one,True,False,bad,,,,,,
you know what he is doing,False,False,good,,,,,,
wait for it,False,False,good,,,,,,
he s fucking with a rhino,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and the rhino does not know what the hell s going on,True,False,bad,,,,,,
he s like you sure about this bro,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and the hippo keeps at it until it does what you are not supposed to do,False,False,good,,,,,,
which is turn your backside to a pissed off rhino,True,True,good,,,,,,
look at that,False,False,good,,,,,,
right in the noodle,False,True,bad,,,,,,
however most of the hippos profound tothidity is reserved for other hippos,False,False,good,,,,,,
a single alpha male has the exclusive right to mate with all the females in the pod,False,False,good,,,,,,
younger horny males hang out on the periphery and take out their sexual frustration on each other,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now if you are having trouble figuring out who is who you are not alone,False,False,good,,,,,,
it turns out it is not that easy to tell the hippopotamuses from the hippopotamisters,True,False,bad,,,,,,
come on that is amazing,False,False,good,,,,,,
well in this shot you can probably tell,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this is essentially what hippopornography looks like,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it s why you do not see very much of it on your websites,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean you might get a shot of a nostril here there but it is sort of boring,False,True,bad,,,,,,
but i suppose do not judge until you have had a hippopotamus on top of yours,True,True,good,,,,,,
it s so bad,False,True,bad,,,,,,
anyway that is how they do it and you know what happens next,False,False,good,,,,,,
this right here is a mummy hippo in the process of giving birth to a brand new baby,False,False,good,,,,,,
birth usually happens under the water and the baby needs to learn quick how to come up for air,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s not all that strong yet and it is still learning to hold its breath,False,False,good,,,,,,
so for the time being mummy helps out with the nudge before it sinks back down like a flesh rock,False,False,good,,,,,,
soon enough though it gets the hang of it,False,False,good,,,,,,
for the first months the mummy hippo will raise the baby away from the pod for reasons that will be painfully obvious,False,False,good,,,,,,
but for now this is about as sweet as a hippo relationship gets,False,True,bad,,,,,,
i mean come on those babies are cute,False,False,good,,,,,,
and look at pygmy hippo babies,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean that is off the charts,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s like a gummy bear come to life,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but parenting out there is not all that easy,False,False,good,,,,,,
no behind that that is a crocodile hot,True,False,bad,,,,,,
hot,True,False,bad,,,,,,
oh for god s sakes,True,True,good,,,,,,
at this size the babies are still vulnerable to predators that would not take on a full grown hippo,False,False,good,,,,,,
so it is helpful to have a full grown hippo around,False,True,bad,,,,,,
look at the animal watching the whole thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
like wildlife rubber necking,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s like suck it leopard,True,True,good,,,,,,
yeah suck oh shit they are leaving,True,True,good,,,,,,
it s a bit of an incredible adventure out there alone with your mother learning how best to hip a bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
and after surviving leopards and lions and crocodiles it is time for them to go back and re enter the pod,False,False,good,,,,,,
which is perhaps more dangerous than all of what they have been through,False,False,good,,,,,,
now let us just say that our little friend made it back just fine,False,False,good,,,,,,
but to understand the hippopotamus you should know that many don t,False,False,good,,,,,,
if a new male is taken over the pod it will often kill returning pups,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s a sad thing but a true thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is the thing with these hippos,False,False,good,,,,,,
they alternate between this sort of serene calm and sudden moments of extreme violence,False,False,good,,,,,,
but that sort of unpredictability might be the best way to stay alive,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they have stayed alive,False,False,good,,,,,,
big buckets of flesh among lions and leopards,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is just how the hippo do,False,False,good,,,,,,
no jerry they are not using farts to echolocate,True,False,bad,,,,,,
how do i know,False,False,good,,,,,,
for one what are they going to do,False,False,good,,,,,,
have a bean burrito three hours before they want to find a carrot,True,False,bad,,,,,,
they cannot just fart on command jerry,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and anyway they know it was not a fart,False,False,good,,,,,,
well i do not know,False,False,good,,,,,,
they look for bubbles jerry,False,False,good,,,,,,
do your magic sonar farts not make bubbles,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no you cannot use my bathtub,True,False,bad,,,,,,
idiot,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so you might see something i ve been working on in the news this week a road map to pandemic resilience,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this is a four real thing that represents a consensus of people with every political belief and expertise like republicans and democrats and libertarians economists and health officials and ethics and civil liberties folks and at least one mathematician all agreeing,False,False,good,,,,,,
so there is a few ways we could respond to this pandemic,False,False,good,,,,,,
in the us we already closed down a lot of stuff for a while and it is hard,False,False,good,,,,,,
but now it looks like the curve is starting to flatten and we know it is going to keep falling in the near term and all of us want to get back to our lives,False,False,good,,,,,,
we do not know exactly what this side of the curve will look like,False,False,good,,,,,,
you ve probably seen versions that are optimistically symmetric but unrealistic,False,False,good,,,,,,
it ll probably look less like this and more like this which i modeled off of spain,False,True,bad,,,,,,
okay so say we reopen soon and whoops that is not ideal,False,True,bad,,,,,,
okay say less affected areas can reopen,False,False,good,,,,,,
new york is still closed and then some of us at least get a month of freedom and economic activity before we have to reshut down and do it all again,False,False,good,,,,,,
and again it would be a reopening roller coaster and it would at least spread out the cases but this plan has a lot of unknowns,False,False,good,,,,,,
it would not be back to business as usual when things are open because businesses will not be able to rely on each other to stay open or on their workers to not all fall sick at once,False,False,good,,,,,,
anywhere could be the next hotspot,False,False,good,,,,,,
it makes it hard to plan and hard to feel safe,False,False,good,,,,,,
so here s another way to respond,False,False,good,,,,,,
the plan that all these folks agree on is to reopen the economy this summer in four phases so that the curve keeps falling and we can stay open while protecting your health and civil liberties,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s three things we need to do this,False,False,good,,,,,,
number one is testing,False,False,good,,,,,,
we simply need more tests a lot more like millions a day and these tests will be fast,False,False,good,,,,,,
no one wants to wait days for their results,False,False,good,,,,,,
number two is tracing,False,False,good,,,,,,
contact tracing is how we let you know if there is a chance you have been exposed so you can get a test and find out fast whether you should isolate to stop it from spreading further,False,False,good,,,,,,
and number three is supported isolation,False,False,good,,,,,,
anyone who tests positive or is waiting for their results needs support isolate at home with health care supplies and job protections,False,False,good,,,,,,
so testing tracing supported isolation,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s possible but it takes resources,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we made our plan as epic as we needed to be to get this done responsibly this summer,False,False,good,,,,,,
okay so first is phase one,False,False,good,,,,,,
here s where we see the curve flatten and fall by giving our essential workers the support and care they need,False,False,good,,,,,,
of the economy is already open,False,False,good,,,,,,
thanks to essential workers like nurses grocery store workers utilities maintenance workers police and firefighters restaurant and delivery workers,False,False,good,,,,,,
they did not ask to be put on the front lines of this crisis but they have stepped up to the challenges,False,False,good,,,,,,
so in phase one we grow our resources to support those essential workers and turn our current limited economy into a pandemic resilient foundation,False,False,good,,,,,,
we ll hear from our neighbors and friends who work in delivery and law enforcement that thanks to testing and tracing they do not have to wonder anymore if they might be spreading the disease without even knowing it,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they do not have to worry about co workers having it without knowing it,False,False,good,,,,,,
when someone tests positive they get sick leave they have other worker protection so no one is worried about getting fired for being sick if they take a test,False,False,good,,,,,,
we ll hear from our elders and care facilities that now there is testing in place to make sure there is no chance for this disease to spread out of control,False,False,good,,,,,,
that goes for anyone in frequent contact with essential workers including folks in jails and prisons,False,False,good,,,,,,
some folks will be going through online training to fill in for essential workers maybe a teacher you know trained to do in home childcare to sub in for someone who is gotten ill and maybe a neighbor who has experienced caring for an elderly relative decides to take the course and is ready to fill in,False,False,good,,,,,,
how and where testing gets done might also depend on the community,False,False,good,,,,,,
we know that the best way to prevent spread is to find out who was in contact with someone who tests positive so that those people can get tested quickly and have results within hours,False,False,good,,,,,,
some communities already have networks of contact tracer that people trust to do this work in a way that protects their rights,False,False,good,,,,,,
while in some communities we might hear about people working together to build these networks,False,False,good,,,,,,
maybe some will use technology to help,False,False,good,,,,,,
the better we are at contact tracing the faster we can move on to phase two,False,False,good,,,,,,
but worst case we just have to make a lot more tests,False,False,good,,,,,,
because in phase one most of us are still isolating at home so we only need to produce enough tests to keep those essential workers safe,False,False,good,,,,,,
meanwhile we will hear about all the innovative ways communities and companies are expanding contact tracing and making it work to bring down the number of cases to where we can move to phase two,False,False,good,,,,,,
in phase two well we have got our stable foundation of,False,False,good,,,,,,
so now we expand essential workers to,False,False,good,,,,,,
communities will be empowered to put programs in place to train and hire more people in essential jobs lightening the burden on the current essential workforce,False,False,good,,,,,,
we ll be able to address supply chain problems,False,False,good,,,,,,
you can find toilet paper in stores and order pasta online again,False,False,good,,,,,,
we might see one city get more buses on the street and hire more folks to drive those buses so that expanded essential workers can get to their jobs safely without being in a crowded environment,False,False,good,,,,,,
another city without buses to spare might invest in hiring a set of workers to build out more public transit infrastructure,False,False,good,,,,,,
more people will get hired to serve in roles in unemployment and retraining so more people can access support,False,False,good,,,,,,
a doctor who is tested positive and has to isolate might teach courses on how to do a swab test,False,False,good,,,,,,
a contact tracer with years experience might partner with their county to start an online training program for contact tracers,False,False,good,,,,,,
maybe the bay area leans heavily on appassisted contact tracing,False,False,good,,,,,,
maybe la partners with an organization like unidos us to work with immigrants on community run contact tracing they trust,False,False,good,,,,,,
in a rural county like mine maybe we do most of our contact tracing the old fashioned way over the phone with one of our local figures that everyone already knows anyway and we can take a test at the old elementary school if we need to,False,False,good,,,,,,
maybe we apply for funding to expand our tiny hospital and there is a demand for construction workers to build it out,False,False,good,,,,,,
during this phase which will probably be most of june we can allow a relaxation of certain social distancing measures for those essential workers on the front lines,False,False,good,,,,,,
we ll still have to cancel large gatherings but the group of expanded essential workers can safely visit and support each other,False,False,good,,,,,,
we ll see restaurants that are currently doing takeout for the general population can be open to serve essential workers on site,False,False,good,,,,,,
if there is any question of exposure there is enough tests to find out and the health resources to respond as necessary,False,False,good,,,,,,
we ll see our friends and relatives in essential sectors go from stress and scared to secure and supported,False,False,good,,,,,,
before long of the population is part of a smoothly working pandemic resilient economy and so we move on to phase three,False,False,good,,,,,,
phase three is short and sweet,False,False,good,,,,,,
it gets our workforce back to though some of us will still be working from home,False,False,good,,,,,,
it lasts just a week or two and by the end there will be no corona induced unemployment,False,False,good,,,,,,
phase three is where non essential businesses like hair and nail salons work that cannot be done remotely will restart with safety precautions like public mask wearing,False,False,good,,,,,,
maybe a friend reopens his hair salon giving priority to essential workers in his community like doctors and bus drivers,False,False,good,,,,,,
he knows they are able to get testing if there is a chance they have been exposed so that if any of his clients do test positive he will be informed by a contact tracer that he should get tested too in case,False,False,good,,,,,,
he makes sure to only have one client in his shop at a time and take special precautions to clean down surfaces between clients,False,False,good,,,,,,
office workers and mathematicians like me will still be working from home in phase three and asked not to go out for just this next week or two but now i can get a home visit from a hair colorist or a massage therapist,False,False,good,,,,,,
i ll leave the on location visits for the workers who do not have the at home job security i have just until we have ramped up our supplies to where we can move on to phase four,False,False,good,,,,,,
phase three also increases support for the unemployed homeless and underhoused,False,False,good,,,,,,
this phase is probably early july so i ll be looking to my county for guidance on whether it is safe to have a small fourth of july gathering maybe keeping our distance outside on the porch or following other recommendations,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then at the end of july we enter phase four,False,False,good,,,,,,
the last of workers still working from home can start going to the office again,False,False,good,,,,,,
you might start going in just a few days a week after taking a test covered by insurance and then working from home for the rest of the week while a different group of workers has in office days,False,False,good,,,,,,
some industries might face things differently and different offices will make different decisions based on guidance and resources,False,False,good,,,,,,
we can plan for summer barbecues with our family and friends because we will have clear guidance about safety and access to tests,False,False,good,,,,,,
we can go to parks and go shopping wearing a mask without fear that coronavirus is lying in weight on every surface,False,False,good,,,,,,
a restaurant owner in new york where tables are usually spaced close together might have to reduce capacity but they are happy to have office workers able to dine out again,False,False,good,,,,,,
in my town maybe most restaurants have enough space that folks can keep a safe distance at about the usual capacity,False,False,good,,,,,,
maybe our local club replaces the dance floor with safely spaced bar tables and they hire local performers to give live shows so that they can charge a cover to make up for reduced capacity,False,False,good,,,,,,
in phase four students can go back to school,False,False,good,,,,,,
well it is probably summer vacation for most but some school districts might have summer classes where students can get out of the house and catch up on what they missed in spring,False,False,good,,,,,,
summer sports teams might have to get creative,False,False,good,,,,,,
football hockey and basketball coaches will be inventing and sharing drills that have reduced contact,False,False,good,,,,,,
parents might take turns attending games so that they can fill every other bleachers seat to maintain distance,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s enough tests that professional sports organizations can pay to have players tested every day to identify cases before they can spread meaning,False,False,good,,,,,,
you can expect to see televised sports again,False,False,good,,,,,,
we ll have enough tests for educational institutions to be able to get additional testing support like maybe my cousins college dorm is pretty crowded so they can expect to test more frequently if they want to stay there,False,False,good,,,,,,
in phase four life enters a comfortable new normal for the year before a vaccine with communities receiving up to date information on what is safe and the economy coming back into full swing,False,False,good,,,,,,
things will not be quite the same we will be wearing masks in public moving large events online and keeping a bit more distance than usual,False,False,good,,,,,,
but some of our investments will benefit us in the long term like expanding our public transportation and health infrastructure,False,False,good,,,,,,
our economy will be pandemic resilient not just for this pandemic but ready to hold strong against future attacks,False,False,good,,,,,,
throughout these four phases we are going to see communities being empowered to find creative ways to reopen in ways that are safe legal and supported with the healthcare infrastructure they need to do testing,False,False,good,,,,,,
trace those who have been exposed care for this sick and support those who must isolate at home,False,False,good,,,,,,
so you might be wondering how do we get these resources available for states and local governments to use,False,False,good,,,,,,
basically we need a pandemic testing board with strong but narrow powers to get the supply chain moving with to billion in funding over two years depending on how effectively we do contact tracing plus unexpanded health reserves,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s a wartime level investment that we are more than capable of and it costs a lot less than repeatedly shutting down the economy in both lives and money,False,False,good,,,,,,
we ve done our homework on this so check it out along with the body of supporting work if you are interested,False,False,good,,,,,,
and people across disciplines and ideologies agree on this plan,False,False,good,,,,,,
we can do this,False,False,good,,,,,,
you can do this,False,False,good,,,,,,
connect with your communities look for ways to be involved or create them where you are,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is for real and i ve never felt so encouraged and hopeful,False,False,good,,,,,,
everyone i ve worked with on this project has jumped in to say what can i do,False,False,good,,,,,,
how can i help,False,False,good,,,,,,
people who disagree on everything else and who would ordinarily refuse to be in a room together are working together on this,False,False,good,,,,,,
in ways i would have never ever expected possible,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s kind of miraculous and i wanted you to know i wanted you to know it is real that if you see it on the news with some big institutional names attached claiming all those good stuff about partnership and cooperation i ve been in the room with these folks i mean virtually in the room but you know and it is true,False,False,good,,,,,,
people are working together,False,False,good,,,,,,
they are deciding together that we can do this and we can,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you are the hashtagging profile picturing type let me tell you hashtag how we reopen,False,False,good,,,,,,
we ve got icons to see the links below like pandemictesting org,False,False,good,,,,,,
let people know including your local leaders and elected officials that they should take a look at this report sooner rather than later,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean we have already got a lot of momentum but things are moving so fast with this pandemic,False,False,good,,,,,,
we could use all the momentum we can get and i m pretty sure time is not obeying the laws of physics right now so yeah your help would be appreciated,False,False,good,,,,,,
okay that is all for today,False,False,good,,,,,,
i send my best to you and i m looking forward to seeing the future you help create,False,False,good,,,,,,
i want to tell you about exotic objects in topology,False,False,good,,,,,,
before i do that let me just tell you more generally what topologists do,False,False,good,,,,,,
we study geometric shapes but unlike in ordinary geometry we do not care about lengths angles areas volumes,False,False,good,,,,,,
we do not care about any of that,False,False,good,,,,,,
we just care about what properties geometric shapes have that are not changed when you deform them,False,False,good,,,,,,
and by deform i mean you are allowed to bend it and twist it and stretch it as if it is made of an elastic material but you are not allowed to break it,False,False,good,,,,,,
so a square for example if we started manipulating that it would very quickly not be a square anymore,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s right,False,False,good,,,,,,
we have a square right here and i could turn it into a circle or more or less a circle by just bending it,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i could also turn it into a triangle,False,False,good,,,,,,
but what i cannot do is turn let us say a circle into two circles,False,False,good,,,,,,
the only way to do this would be to break it and then glue it back but that is not allowed,False,False,good,,,,,,
similarly i could have a ball and i could turn it into a cube,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s a saying that topologists are people who cannot tell a part donuts from coffee mugs,True,True,good,,,,,,
so for example here is a donut,False,False,good,,,,,,
and here is a coffee mug,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mean they are the same,False,False,good,,,,,,
they re the same for us because you could deform one into the other,False,False,good,,,,,,
they both have this hole through them,False,False,good,,,,,,
but what i cannot do is turn the donut into a ball because the ball does not have a hole,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i do not want to punch a hole in it,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s not allowed,False,False,good,,,,,,
and well i could do that by taking a bite out of the donut,False,True,bad,,,,,,
but with topologist or healthy people were not supposed to be eating donuts,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the objects that we mostly care about are called manifolds,False,False,good,,,,,,
these are objects that look from any given point they look pretty much like flat space or n dimensional hyper space,False,False,good,,,,,,
what is n dimensional hyper space,False,False,good,,,,,,
in dimension one we have a line,False,False,good,,,,,,
in dimension two we have the plane,False,False,good,,,,,,
in dimension three we have space,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then you can think about dimension four just add another variable say time,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is four dimensional hyper space,False,False,good,,,,,,
and you can just add more variables five dimensional and six dimensional and so on,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s not something that we can visualize but we can think of it mathematically anyway,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we can write down equations,False,False,good,,,,,,
and manifold in this space,False,False,good,,,,,,
or are manifolds in space themselves,False,False,good,,,,,,
they can sit in the space but they could also look like that space around any point,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let me tell you an example,False,False,good,,,,,,
the surface of the earth is a great example,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s a sphere more or less,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s called a geowide,False,False,good,,,,,,
it has mountains and valleys,False,False,good,,,,,,
but remember we can all deform them and make it into a sphere,False,False,good,,,,,,
topological it is a sphere,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it sits in three dimensional space,False,False,good,,,,,,
but around any point it looks like two dimensional plane,False,False,good,,,,,,
because i can move basically two directions,False,False,good,,,,,,
i can move left and right and forwards and backwards,False,False,good,,,,,,
there are two degrees of freedom,False,False,good,,,,,,
so that is what i m saying,False,False,good,,,,,,
that the sphere is a two dimensional manifold even though it lives in three dimensional space,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok other examples of two dimensional manifolds would be the surface of the donut,False,False,good,,,,,,
or this famous klein bottle,False,False,good,,,,,,
yes if i live on it again i would not be able to tell the difference from a plane,False,False,good,,,,,,
just like it is pretty hard to tell the difference between a plane and the earth the sphere from where we are,False,False,good,,,,,,
to really tell them apart you would have to go far away and see that you come back,False,False,good,,,,,,
there are also one dimensional manifolds,False,False,good,,,,,,
like the circle right here,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s a one dimensional manifold,False,False,good,,,,,,
if we only lived on the circle then we would only have one direction in which to move in,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then there are three dimensional manifolds like our ordinary space or the universe,False,False,good,,,,,,
around every point it looks like we have three dimensions to go into,False,False,good,,,,,,
we also have the bottom and top,False,False,good,,,,,,
but we actually do not know the shape of the universe,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s a three dimensional manifold,False,False,good,,,,,,
it could be hyperspace but it could be what is called a three dimensional hypersphere,False,False,good,,,,,,
perhaps if we go very high up then we would come back to where we are,False,False,good,,,,,,
nobody has done that but we do not know if it is possible or not,False,False,good,,,,,,
just like on the surface of the earth when you go around you come back,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we just know it is a three dimensional manifold,False,False,good,,,,,,
is there no way to test for that,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s strange that we could not know that even the one we are living in the one we are living and breathing in,False,False,good,,,,,,
that is the only way to test to walk forever and see if i come back,False,False,good,,,,,,
no there are other ways,False,False,good,,,,,,
people are looking at the cosmic microwave background radiation,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they have put forward various theories about what the shape of the universe is,False,False,good,,,,,,
but there is no definite theory that everyone accepts,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s not yet known what shape it is,False,False,good,,,,,,
but there are some hints from the universe,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok so we have three dimensional objects and then we can think about four dimensionals and so on,False,False,good,,,,,,
a good example is this hypersphere,False,False,good,,,,,,
so in dimension one we have the circle which is a one dimensional manifold and it is the set of points at the given distance from the origin,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s given by the equation x squared plus y squared equals one,False,False,good,,,,,,
similarly we have this sphere which is again the set of points at distance one from a given point but it lives in three dimensional space and it is given by the equation x squared plus y squared plus z squared equals one,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we can generalize this,False,False,good,,,,,,
we can talk about the n dimensional hypersphere which is given by the equation x squared plus dot dot dot plus xn squared plus another variable xn plus one squared equals one,False,False,good,,,,,,
it lives in n plus one dimensional space and it is an n dimensional manifold,False,False,good,,,,,,
now i m getting to the crux of the matter the exotic objects,False,False,good,,,,,,
what are exotic objects,False,False,good,,,,,,
these are things that are topologically the same but are smoothly different,False,False,good,,,,,,
so there are two ways of thinking about the formations in topology,False,False,good,,,,,,
i showed you before that a circle can be turned into a square and in the process of course you have to make a corner,False,False,good,,,,,,
now the circle is smooth and you can turn it into other smooth curves like maybe something like an elix and the process would be smooth,False,False,good,,,,,,
now could it be that we have two smooth objects and you can deform one into the other but the only way to do so is by making corners somewhere in the middle,False,False,good,,,,,,
then those objects would be topologically the same but smoothly different,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i do not know if you are more familiar with one of the objects you would say that the second one is an exotic copy of the other one,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s like if you live on the first object and you go to the second one it is like going to an exotic location,False,False,good,,,,,,
some things are the same but some things are just different,False,False,good,,,,,,
now how can this be,False,False,good,,,,,,
how can you have two smooth things but to deform one into the other you need to make corners,False,False,good,,,,,,
here is an example,False,False,good,,,,,,
we have a figure eight and can i turn it into a circle,False,False,good,,,,,,
well i can do so if i make one of the loops smaller and smaller but at some point i have to make a corner and then it becomes a circle,False,False,good,,,,,,
now that is not actually a good example,False,False,good,,,,,,
because if i had a third dimension if i allow myself to just lift this up then it would become a circle just smoothly,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this is not a real example of exotic objects,False,False,good,,,,,,
in fact i cannot show you exotic objects because they do not exist in dimensions one two and three in the dimensions that we can easily visualize,False,False,good,,,,,,
they only start existing in dimension four and higher,False,False,good,,,,,,
the first examples were found in by a mathematician called john melner and they were found in dimension seven,False,False,good,,,,,,
they are exotic hypersphere of seven dimensions,False,False,good,,,,,,
so there is some object on exotic sphere that you can deform into the ordinary seven dimensional sphere but not smoothly,False,False,good,,,,,,
an exotic sphere is a smooth object that i can deform into a sphere,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i cannot deform it smoothly,False,False,good,,,,,,
i would have to make corners in the middle,False,False,good,,,,,,
let me show you now the numbers of spheres in each dimension,False,False,good,,,,,,
in dimension one two three there is just one the standard one,False,False,good,,,,,,
the same goes in dimensions five and six,False,False,good,,,,,,
now in dimension seven we actually have spheres,False,False,good,,,,,,
so there is the standard one and then there are different ones,False,False,good,,,,,,
then we have two spheres in dimension eight then eight then six then in dimension eleven we have spheres,False,False,good,,,,,,
in dimension twelve we have just one then three then two then sixteen thousand then two hundred and fifty six and so on,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you look at the sequence of numbers it looks strange,False,False,good,,,,,,
i grant you that but there are some patterns,False,False,good,,,,,,
for example in dimensions seven eleven fifteen every four dimensions you get a lot more exotic spheres than in the other nearby dimensions,False,False,good,,,,,,
one thing you can ask is in what dimensions do exotics spheres exist,False,False,good,,,,,,
and in what dimensions does just the standard one,False,False,good,,,,,,
we see that there is just one sphere in dimensions one two three five six twelve and also mathematicians figure it out,False,False,good,,,,,,
the same is true in dimensions fifty six and sixty one,False,False,good,,,,,,
so does that mean if i was an object living in a sixty one dimensional universe it is a little bit more boring than some of the other ones,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that s right yes these are the boring dimensions you do not have exotic spheres,True,False,bad,,,,,,
although you do have some other exotic objects in these dimensions just not spheres,False,False,good,,,,,,
these numbers seem so arbitrary,False,False,good,,,,,,
i assume it is impossible for someone to easily explain why it is certain numbers that are boring and other ones that are hyper exotic,False,False,good,,,,,,
these numbers are hard to compute does a whole story involving bernoulli numbers and homotopic groups of spheres,False,False,good,,,,,,
the most interesting thing about them is that we can compute them in any dimension except in dimension four,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s where i left question mark,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s the biggest mystery,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s one of the most famous open problems in topology,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s called the four dimensional smooth point correct conjecture which says that there are no exotic spheres in dimension four,False,False,good,,,,,,
but we do not know that for sure yet,False,False,good,,,,,,
we do not know,False,False,good,,,,,,
there are examples of objects that are smooth and you can deform them into the ordinary four dimensional sphere by introducing corners,False,False,good,,,,,,
but people do not know if you can do that smoothly or not,False,False,good,,,,,,
i have also looked for exotic four dimensional sphere myself and i could not find any,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you did would you become a very famous mathematician,False,False,good,,,,,,
absolutely,False,False,good,,,,,,
is it not like a millennium problem,False,False,good,,,,,,
is it anything or is it,False,False,good,,,,,,
no there was a similar conjecture in dimension three the poin correct conjecture,False,False,good,,,,,,
that was the one problem in topology among my millennium problems that was solved by peralman in,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i think now the most famous remaining open problem in topology is this one about dimension four,False,False,good,,,,,,
but it has not yet made it to the list of millennium problems,False,False,good,,,,,,
professor do not waste your time making numberphile videos,True,True,good,,,,,,
you need to go upstairs and solve this problem,True,False,bad,,,,,,
numberphile videos are important too,True,False,bad,,,,,,
all right,False,False,good,,,,,,
so why is dimension four so difficult,False,False,good,,,,,,
good question,False,False,good,,,,,,
well it is more difficult than the lower dimensions,False,False,good,,,,,,
one two three becomes in those dimensions we can see things,False,False,good,,,,,,
and there are also geometric techniques that mathematicians use to study shapes in these dimensions,False,False,good,,,,,,
what s interesting is that it is also simpler than dimensions five six and greater,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the reason for that is a trick about separating disks,False,False,good,,,,,,
to explain it let me say one way in which topologists distinguish between shapes,False,False,good,,,,,,
if i have a lasso and i throw it somewhere on the plane or even on the surface of the earth which is a sphere it would surround a region,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i could just contract it into a blob around a little point,False,False,good,,,,,,
but if i have the same lasso and i would put it around the surface around the hole in a donut then i would not be able to contract it without breaking the donut,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is one way you can tell the donut apart from the sphere,False,False,good,,,,,,
so to study these objects mathematicians are looking at loops and how you contract them,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the contraction spans a disk,False,False,good,,,,,,
a disk is a two dimensional object,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it is easier to study these objects if you can split apart the disks so that you can study each complication one at a time,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right how can you split apart disks,False,False,good,,,,,,
well let me start with lines,False,False,good,,,,,,
if i have two lines and they are on the plane and they intersect if i move one a little bit i m not going to be able to take it off the other,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i can take it off if i allow myself to go into space,False,False,good,,,,,,
the reason is that three is greater than one plus one,False,False,good,,,,,,
each line is a one dimensional object and one plus one is two but i have one extra dimension,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is why i can do it,False,False,good,,,,,,
similarly if i m interested in separating disks each disk is a two dimensional object and two plus two is four so i need one extra dimension,False,False,good,,,,,,
so in dimensions five and higher i can separate disks,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that just makes topological objects easier to study,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is called the whitney trick and it led to the classification of smooth manifolds in higher dimensions back in the s,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this is the problem with dimension four,False,False,good,,,,,,
you can t in dimension four you have not got the space to separate two disks,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s right,False,False,good,,,,,,
we do not have the geometric methods from lower dimensions and we do not have the trick about separating disks,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that makes dimension four the hardest to wrap our heads around,False,False,good,,,,,,
to give you an example of something that is unique to dimension four instead of looking at exotic spheres let us look at exotic hyperspaces,False,False,good,,,,,,
remember we had the line and then the plane and then the space,False,False,good,,,,,,
and in end dimensions we have the hyperspace,False,False,good,,,,,,
so could you have an exotic hyperspace,False,False,good,,,,,,
something that looks like a plane or a space and you can deform it into the ordinary one but only by making corners,False,False,good,,,,,,
here are the numbers of hyperspaces in each dimension,False,False,good,,,,,,
in any dimension except four there is just one,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s just a standard one and there are no exotic hyperspaces,False,False,good,,,,,,
but in dimension four we have infinitely many,False,False,good,,,,,,
in fact it is more than infinitely many,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s uncountably many,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s not the kind of infinity that you can count one two three and so on,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s as many exotic hyperspaces as there are real numbers,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this does not happen in any other dimensions,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you have exotic objects in some other dimensions you know that there are always finitely many of them,False,False,good,,,,,,
there s finitely many exotic spheres so as i showed you that list of numbers,False,False,good,,,,,,
but in dimension four you can have infinitely many exotic objects,False,False,good,,,,,,
and yeah that is what makes dimension four so fascinating,False,False,good,,,,,,
does this mean dimension four is something that you should be spending more time on because it is so special,False,False,good,,,,,,
or is this a sign that maybe this is a bit of an aberration that you should leave alone,False,False,good,,,,,,
it s a place where you should not play,False,False,good,,,,,,
that depends on your own perspective,False,False,good,,,,,,
there are mathematicians who work on the other dimensions,False,False,good,,,,,,
and there are mathematicians that work on dimension four,False,False,good,,,,,,
i m in the latter category,False,False,good,,,,,,
because quite often when i speak to number theorists and they talk to me about prime numbers and they are showing me some interesting property of prime numbers they very often discard two,False,False,good,,,,,,
they say we are not going to use two because that is an aberration,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it ruins everything,False,False,good,,,,,,
it ruins all our laws and principles on that,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they just throw it aside,False,False,good,,,,,,
it sounds like the fourth dimension is your equivalent,False,False,good,,,,,,
that s pretty much it,False,False,good,,,,,,
in many theorems you say this is happening in all dimensions except four,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we understand what is happening,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we just do not know what is happening in dimension four,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i find that interesting and worthy of study,False,False,good,,,,,,
