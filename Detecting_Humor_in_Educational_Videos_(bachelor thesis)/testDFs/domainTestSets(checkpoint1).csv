the mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works and it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities just like a coral it is a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around since we only ever get to experience one possibility this quantum weirdness was first described by erwin and his cat the cat likes this version better,True,True,good,1654.0,433.0,0.71,0.79,1.0,0.83
but physics does tell us what particles can be produced these particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and any particles more massive than this energy limit arent produced and remain invisible to us this is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting it is going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what is ever been done before so were going to get to see some new particles very soon but before talking about what we might see let me describe the particles we already know of there is a whole zoo of subatomic particles most of us are familiar with electrons a lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around,True,True,good,,,,,,
electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino with no electric charge and a very tiny mass in contrast the up and down quarks have very large masses and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms all of these matter particles come in and right handed varieties and have partners that carry opposite charges these familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses these matter particles all interact with the various force particles the electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons there is also a very weak force called rather the weak force,True,True,good,,,,,,
circles and other geometrical figures of course when other physicists and i actually work on this stuff the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth but it is reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure beautiful geometry joined with quantum mechanics this mathematics describes our universe as a growing coral with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern and as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the large collider we may be able to see whether nature uses this pattern or a different one this process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in if the finds particles that fit this pattern that will be very very cool if the finds new particles but they dont fit this pattern well that will be very interesting but bad for this theory and of course bad for me personally,True,False,bad,,,,,,
predicting how nature works is a very risky game this theory and others like it are long shots one does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably wont end up being true about nature that is what doing theoretical physics is like there are a lot of in this regard new physics theories are a lot like start up companies as with any large investment it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it isnt working out but in science if something isnt working you have to toss it out and try something else now the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life ive tried the best i can to live a balanced life,True,False,bad,,,,,,
work on comes to nothing i still know ive lived a good life and i try to live in beautiful places for most of the past ten years ive lived on the island of maui a very beautiful place now it is one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how i managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full time employment,True,True,good,,,,,,
going to let you in on that secret this was a view from my home office on maui and this is another and another and you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar but in slightly different places that s because this used to be my home and office on maui,True,False,bad,,,,,,
down to the smallest possible scales so the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is all possibilities are expanding and developing at once and this is why i use the analogy to coral and in this way the way that comes in is it will be as a shape that is attached at each point in the space time and as i said the way the shape twists the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface is what the elementary particles are themselves so through quantum field theory they manifest themselves as points and interact that way i dont know if ill be able to make this any clearer,True,True,good,,,,,,
actually for the next minutes im going to do the best i can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations it turns out there is a lot we can learn from coral a coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal each coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps,False,False,good,,,,,,
it turns out there is a lot we can learn from coral a coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal each coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps these polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors if we imagine this to be a coral we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question we can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors if it was just chance or destiny or what now after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high he would tell us that our question was completely stupid these corals can be kind of mean you see and i have surfing scars to prove that but this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him that he was in all these other locations as well but experiencing them as separate individuals,False,False,good,,,,,,
this seems weird to us because each of us only experiences an individual existence and we dont get to see other branches it is as if each of us like here are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities the mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales it can be summed up in a single sentence everything that can happen does that is quantum mechanics but this does not mean everything happens the rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what cant what physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced,False,False,good,,,,,,
this enormous machine the large collider at cern in geneva has a circumference of miles and when it is operating draws five times as much power as the city of monterey we cant predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized but physics does tell us what particles can be produced,False,False,good,,,,,,
the strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge called color charge and come in three different varieties red green and blue you can blame murray gell mann for these names theyre his fault finally there is the force of gravity which interacts with matter via its mass and spin the most important thing to understand here is that there is a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces these four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has,False,False,good,,,,,,
these four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has a particle that hasnt been seen yet but were pretty sure exists is the higgs particle which gives masses to all these other particles the main purpose of the large collider is to see this higgs particle and were almost certain it will but the greatest mystery is what else we might see and im going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk now if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges there are that is a lot of particles to keep track of and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles,False,False,good,,,,,,
that is a lot of particles to keep track of and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles but if we plot them out according to their charges some beautiful patterns emerge the most familiar charge is electric charge electrons have an electric charge a negative one and quarks have electric charges in thirds so when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton it has a total electric charge of plus one these particles also have which have opposite charges now it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges and weak charge if we spread out the and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two dimensional charge space the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction,False,False,good,,,,,,
now it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges and weak charge if we spread out the and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two dimensional charge space the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction the electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their and weak charge which make this pattern this is called the unified model and it was put together back in the reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the higgs particle the higgs over here on the left has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this pattern it makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass since this massive higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram the photons of electromagnetism remain and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space so the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two dimensional space,False,False,good,,,,,,
for example this weak force particle and its can be created in a collision in further interactions the charges must always balance one of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an and these three still add to zero total charge nature always keeps a perfect balance so these patterns of charges are not just pretty they tell us what interactions are allowed to happen and we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction which has this nice hexagonal symmetry in a strong interaction a strong force particle such as this one interacts with a colored quark such as this green one to give a quark with a different color charge this red one and strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies holding the atomic nuclei together,False,False,good,,,,,,
two weeks ago i was in my studio in paris and the phone rang and i heard hey jr you won the ted prize you have to make a wish to save the world i was lost i mean i cant save the world nobody can the world is fucked e on you have dictators ruling the world population is growing by millions there is no more fish in the sea the north pole is melting and as the last ted prize winner said were all becoming fat,True,True,good,,,,,,
whatever so i called back and i told her look amy tell the ted guys i just wont show up i cant do anything to save the world she said hey jr your wish is not to save the world but to change the world oh all right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so that is paris i would change depending on the places i would go the title of the exhibition that is on the champs elysees i was quite proud of that one because i was just and i was just up there on the top of the champs elysees then when the photo left the frame was still there,True,True,good,,,,,,
the army will shoot you and hamas will kidnap you we said okay let us try and push as far as we can i love the way that people will ask me how big will my photo be it will be as big as your house when we did the wall we did the palestinian side so we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough and so palestinians guys say calm down no wait im going to find you a solution so he went to the church of nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen jesus being born,True,True,good,,,,,,
this is kenya one of the largest slums of africa you might have seen images about the post election violence that happened there in this time we covered the roofs of the houses but we didnt use paper because paper doesnt prevent the rain from leaking inside the house vinyl does then art becomes useful so the people kept it you know what i love is for example when you see the biggest eye there there are so many houses inside and i went there a few months ago photos are still there and it was missing a piece of the eye so i asked the people what happened oh that guy just moved,True,True,good,,,,,,
each project that is a film from women are heroes okay for each project we do a film and most of what you see that is a trailer from women are heroes its images photography taken one after the other and the photos kept traveling even without us,True,True,good,,,,,,
art is not supposed to change the world to change practical things but to change perceptions art can change the way we see the world art can create an analogy actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions and then enables you to change the world when i do my work i have two kinds of reactions people say oh why dont you go in iraq or afghanistan they would be really useful or how can we help i presume that you belong to the second category and that is good because for that project im going to ask you to take the photos and paste them so now my wish is i wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project and together well turn the world inside out,True,True,good,,,,,,
i mean technology politics business do change the world not always in a good way but they do what about art could art change the world i started when i was years old and at that time i was not thinking about changing the world i was doing graffiti writing my name everywhere using the city as a canvas,False,False,good,,,,,,
and at that time i was not thinking about changing the world i was doing graffiti writing my name everywhere using the city as a canvas i was going in the tunnels of paris on the rooftops with my friends each trip was an excursion was an adventure it was like leaving our mark on society to say i was here on the top of a building so when i found a cheap camera on the subway i started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies really small photos just that size that is how at years old i started pasting them and i did my first expo de rue which means sidewalk gallery and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising,False,False,good,,,,,,
then i saw it could it be possible my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car a pasting id done a year earlier an illegal one still there i mean these were the faces of my friends i know those guys all of them are not angels but theyre not monsters either so it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television so i went back there with a lens it was the only one i had at that time,False,False,good,,,,,,
i went back there with a lens it was the only one i had at that time but with that lens you have to be as close as inches from the person so you can do it only with their trust so i took full portraits of people from le they were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves and then i pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of paris with the name age even building number of these guys a year later the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of paris and we go from thug images whove been stolen and distorted by the media who is now proudly taking over his own image,False,False,good,,,,,,
so with my friend marco we decided to go there and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis are they so different when we got there we just went in the street started talking with people everywhere and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media so we decided to take portraits of palestinians and israelis doing the same jobs taxi driver lawyer cooks asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment not a smile that really doesnt tell about who you are and what you feel they all accepted to be pasted next to the other i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall we launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever we called the project face face,False,False,good,,,,,,
the experts said no way the people will not accept the army will shoot you and hamas will kidnap you we said okay let us try and push as far as we can i love the way that people will ask me how big will my photo be it will be as big as your house when we did the wall we did the palestinian side,False,False,good,,,,,,
he purchased his own plane ticket and went to the village where this had occurred and he was confronted by this scene a line of coffins coming down a hill relatives wailing he later he told me how overwhelmed he felt and didnt know what to do so he took out his phone like any one of us might and snapped that picture and it out and voila that picture went viral and broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it so when a year later turkey s protests happened it started as a protest about a park being razed but became an anti authoritarian protest it wasnt surprising that media also censored it but it got a little ridiculous at times when things were so intense when cnn international was broadcasting live from istanbul cnn turkey instead was broadcasting a documentary on penguins now i love penguin documentaries but that wasnt the news of the day an angry viewer put his two screens together and snapped that picture and that one too went viral and since then people call turkish media the penguin media,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so recently we heard a lot about how social media helps empower protest and that is true but after more than a decade of studying and participating in multiple social movements ive come to realize that the way technology empowers social movements can also paradoxically help weaken them this is not inevitable but overcoming it requires diving deep into what makes success possible over the long term and the lessons apply in multiple domains now take turkey s park protests july which i went back to study in the field was key to its organizing it was everywhere in the park well along with a lot of tear gas,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is my favorite place on earth de in bolivia and when it is covered in a thin layer of water it reflects the clouds there are days when you feel as if youre floating among the clouds but there are days when the horizon disappears there is no longer a top or a bottom you feel immersed in something bigger it was there that one night i woke up from a dream and i saw that the stars were also reflected on the water,False,False,good,,,,,,
i turn out to be the son you wanted when i was born did i meet your expectations youve exceeded my expectations sweetie because sure you have these fantasies of what your child s going to be like but you have made me grow so much as a parent because you think well i was the one who made you a parent you were the one who made me a parent that s a good point,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i love you i love you i love you when a guy is happily married no matter what happens at work no matter what happens in the rest of the day there is a shelter when you get home there is a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody without them throwing you downstairs and saying get your hands off me being married is like having a color television set you never want to go back to black and white,True,True,good,,,,,,
it was the first time the story of stonewall had been told to a national audience,False,False,good,,,,,,
they lived in cubicles the size of prison cells covered with chicken wire so you couldnt jump from one room into the next,False,False,good,,,,,,
in fact i could see them through the window lying on the dining room table where i had left them so i quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows and they were locked tight i thought about calling a locksmith at least i had my cellphone but at midnight it could take a while for a locksmith to show up and it was cold i couldnt go back to my friend jeff s house for the night because i had an early flight to europe the next morning and i needed to get my passport and my suitcase so desperate and freezing cold i found a large rock and i broke through the basement window cleared out the shards of glass i crawled through i found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening figuring that in the morning on the way to the airport i could call my contractor and ask him to fix it this was going to be expensive but probably no more expensive than a middle night locksmith so i figured under the circumstances i was coming out even now im a neuroscientist by training and i know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress it releases that raises your heart rate it adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking so the next morning when i woke up on too little sleep worrying about the hole in the window and a mental note that i had to call my contractor and the freezing temperatures and the meetings i had upcoming in europe and you know with all the in my brain my thinking was cloudy but i didnt know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it wasnt until i got to the airport check in counter that i realized i didnt have my passport,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i raced home in the snow and ice minutes got my passport raced back to the airport i made it just in time but they had given away my seat to someone else so i got stuck in the back of the plane next to the bathrooms in a seat that wouldnt on an eight hour flight well i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep,True,True,good,,,,,,
and i started wondering are there things that i can do systems that i can put into place that will prevent bad things from happening or at least if bad things happen will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe so i started thinking about that but my thoughts didnt crystallize until about a month later i was having dinner with my colleague danny the nobel prize winner and i somewhat told him about having broken my window and you know forgotten my passport and danny shared with me that hed been practicing something called prospective hindsight,True,True,good,,,,,,
i had just driven home it was around midnight in the dead of montreal winter i had been visiting my friend jeff across town and the thermometer on the front porch read minus degrees and dont bother asking if that is celsius or fahrenheit minus is where the two scales meet it was very cold and as i stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets i found i didnt have my keys in fact i could see them through the window lying on the dining room table where i had left them so i quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows and they were locked tight i thought about calling a locksmith at least i had my cellphone but at midnight it could take a while for a locksmith to show up and it was cold,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is something that he had gotten from the psychologist gary klein who had written about it a few years before also called the pre mortem now you all know what the postmortem is whenever there is a disaster a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong right well in the pre mortem danny explained you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening or to minimize the damage so what i want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre mortem some of them are obvious some of them are not so obvious,False,False,good,,,,,,
around the home designate a place for things that are easily lost now this sounds like common sense and it is but there is a lot of science to back this up based on the way our spatial memory works there is a structure in the brain called the that evolved over tens of thousands of years to keep track of the locations of important things where the well is where fish can be found that stand of fruit trees where the friendly and enemy tribes live the is the part of the brain that in london taxicab drivers becomes enlarged it is the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts and if youre wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find their nuts,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts and if youre wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find their nuts they werent using smell they were using the this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things but it is really good for things that dont move around much not so good for things that move around so this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports so in the home designate a spot for your keys a hook by the door maybe a decorative bowl for your passport a particular drawer for your reading glasses a particular table if you designate a spot and youre scrupulous about it your things will always be there when you look for them,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think the only thing less happy is the grass that we did probably damage quite badly you get an idea of the thrust here when i try to hold them horizontally and somewhat fail that is around kilos of thrust there we were quite impressed with that we thought we were getting somewhere so there is only one sensible way to go from there you get four,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it really didnt work did it trying things and learning by failing at them most of the time and that included failing by falling over if you notice weve got five engines here not to be put off by the fact one was in maintenance still had a go,True,True,good,,,,,,
line so again good learning we learned not to do that again this was a blind alley,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this was three on each arm that was ridiculous that was kilos on each arm again struck that one off,True,True,good,,,,,,
that was the point where this endeavor went from im really not sure this is going to work to oh my god it does work from there on we then refined it but we carried on falling over a lot falling over like i say is definitely the best way to learn after a while we starting really refining the layout of all of this and youll see that is stability and control there is no wires there or anything that is a combination of us refining the technology including with a tupperware box on the back for the electronics and actually learning the balance and control im now going to save your ears for the next short piece and talk over it after a while the jet engine noise is a bit annoying,False,False,good,,,,,,
well i dont think anybody s going to go down to walmart or take the kids to school in any of this stuff for a while but the team at gravity are building some awesome technology that is going to make this look like child s play were working on some things that will seek to bring this unusual experience of flight to a wider audience beyond the events and displays were doing were even starting to look for pilots two and three if there is any volunteers ive got this vision it sounds audacious but let us just stick it out there that one day maybe we can rise up above a beach fly up and down the coastline of it rise up a bit higher with some of the safety kit were working on to make this achievable then over the horizon comes a hercules with the ramp down as it comes past you start picking up speed and see if we can intercept from the rear not the front that would be a mistake and then try and land in the back,False,False,good,,,,,,
but this is also if i take a big step back from this this is also a very personal journey for me back to that lovely photo or photo in a picture sadly my father took his own life when i was and left an awful lot of unfulfilled ambition he was a wonderful inventor a maverick creator and id just like to think if it was possible if he was looking down he would be hed certainly be smiling at some of the things weve done here i think so it is a tribute to him,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i said ok you guys spent the whole summer on this right no we all took internships just in case it doesnt work out all right but youre going to go in full time once you graduate not exactly weve all lined up backup jobs six months go by it is the day before the company launches and there is still not a functioning website you guys realize the entire company is a website that is literally all it is so i obviously declined to invest and they ended up naming the company parker,True,True,good,,,,,,
so the first reason that i passed on parker was they were really slow getting off the ground now you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a well i have a confession for you im the opposite im a yes that is an actual term you know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline when you havent done anything yet i just feel that a few months ahead of time,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so this started early when i was a kid i took nintendo games very seriously i would wake up at start playing and not stop until i had mastered them eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side of nintendo starring me,True,True,good,,,,,,
no she was one of our most creative students and as an organizational psychologist this is the kind of idea that i test so i challenged her to get some data she goes into a bunch of companies she has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are and sure enough the like me who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately so i want to know what happens to the chronic she was like i dont know they didnt fill out my survey,True,True,good,,,,,,
we asked people to generate new business ideas and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative and useful they are and some of them are asked to do the task right away others we randomly assign to procrastinate by dangling minesweeper in front of them for either five or minutes and sure enough the moderate are percent more creative than the other two groups now minesweeper is awesome but it is not the driver of the effect because if you play the game first before you learn about the task there is no creativity boost it is only when youre told that youre going to be working on this problem and then you start procrastinating but the task is still active in the back of your mind that you start to incubate procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas to think in nonlinear ways to make unexpected leaps so just as we were finishing these experiments i was starting to write a book about originals and i thought this is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate while writing a chapter on procrastination so i and like any self respecting i woke up early the next morning and i made a to do list with steps on how to procrastinate,True,True,good,,,,,,
what you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of percent compared with only percent for the look at waiting to build a social network until after and look at waiting for years after altavista and yahoo it is much easier to improve on somebody else s idea than it is to create something new from scratch so the lesson i learned is that to be original you dont have to be first you just have to be different and better but that wasnt the only reason i passed on parker they were also full of doubts they had backup plans lined up and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original because i expected that originals would look something like this,True,True,good,,,,,,
now on the surface a lot of original people look confident but behind the scenes they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do they just manage it differently let me show you this is a depiction of how the creative process works for most of us,True,False,bad,,,,,,
de is when you look at something youve seen many times before and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes it is a screenwriter who looks at a movie script that cant get the green light for more than half a century in every past version the main character has been an evil queen but jennifer lee starts to question whether that makes sense she rewrites the first act the villain as a tortured hero and frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever so there is a simple message from this story when you feel doubt dont let it go,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but i have some good news for you you are not going to get judged on your bad ideas a lot of people think they will if you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up they were afraid of embarrassing themselves of looking stupid but guess what originals have lots and lots of bad ideas tons of them in fact take the guy who invented this do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids but adults too no you celebrate thomas edison for pioneering the light bulb,True,True,good,,,,,,
seven years ago a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company he said im working with three friends and were going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online and i said ok you guys spent the whole summer on this right no we all took internships just in case it doesnt work out all right but youre going to go in full time once you graduate not exactly,False,False,good,,,,,,
they were recently recognized as the world s most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars and now my wife handles our investments why was i so wrong to find out ive been studying people that i come to call originals originals are nonconformists people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them,False,False,good,,,,,,
to find out ive been studying people that i come to call originals originals are nonconformists people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them they are people who stand out and speak up originals drive creativity and change in the world theyre the people you want to bet on and they look nothing like i expected i want to show you today three things ive learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them so the first reason that i passed on parker was they were really slow getting off the ground now you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a,False,False,good,,,,,,
no here are our results you actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off that they dont have any new ideas and on the flip side the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they dont have original thoughts either there is a sweet spot where originals seem to live why is this maybe original people just have bad work habits,False,False,good,,,,,,
i call it thinking,False,False,good,,,,,,
as aaron sorkin put it you call it procrastinating i call it thinking and along the way i discovered that a lot of great originals in history were take leonardo da vinci he toiled on and off for years on the mona lisa he felt like a failure he wrote as much in his journal but some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter what about martin luther king jr,False,False,good,,,,,,
but some of the diversions he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter what about martin luther king jr the night before the biggest speech of his life the march on washington he was up past rewriting it he is sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines when he gets onstage minutes in he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words that changed the course of history i have a dream that was not in the script by delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas and because the text wasnt set in stone he had freedom to improvise procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity but it can be a virtue for creativity,False,False,good,,,,,,
procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity but it can be a virtue for creativity what you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start but theyre slow to finish and this is what i missed with parker when they were dragging their heels for six months i looked at them and said you know a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online they missed the first mover advantage but what i didnt realize was they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online and it turns out the first mover advantage is mostly a myth look at a classic study of over product categories comparing the first movers who created the market with the who introduced something different and better,False,False,good,,,,,,
now in my research i discovered there are two different kinds of doubt there is self doubt and idea doubt self doubt is paralyzing it leads you to freeze but idea doubt is energizing it motivates you to test to experiment to refine just like did,False,False,good,,,,,,
musk told me recently he didnt expect tesla to succeed he was sure the first few launches would fail to make it to orbit let alone get back but it was too important not to try and for so many of us when we have an important idea we dont bother to try but i have some good news for you you are not going to get judged on your bad ideas a lot of people think they will if you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea their most important suggestion percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you look across fields the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most because theyre the ones who try the most take classical composers the best of the best why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions more times one of the best predictors is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate the more output you churn out the more variety you get and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original even the three icons of classical music bach beethoven mozart had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces,False,False,good,,,,,,

he then ran twice for the senate lost twice everyone is broken by life ernest hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought hell look like a figurehead compared to these people they said why are you doing this lincoln he said look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril i need them by my side but perhaps my old friend lyndon johnson might have put it in less noble fashion better to have your enemies inside the tent out than outside the tent in,True,True,good,,,,,,
relationship with him began on a rather curious level i was selected as a white house fellow when i was years old we had a big dance at the white house president johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar there were only three women out of the white house fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the white house but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people id been active in the anti vietnam war movement and had written an article against lyndon johnson which unfortunately came out in the new republic two days after the dance in the white house,True,True,good,,,,,,
he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which i later discovered which is that half of them werent true but they were great nonetheless,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when i didnt have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese and a red checked tablecloth all the romantic trappings and he started out doris more than any other woman i have ever known and my heart sank and then he said you remind me of my mother,True,True,good,,,,,,
when i was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games so that when he went to work in new york during the day i could record for him the history of that afternoon s brooklyn dodgers game now when youre only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you as i now realize that i in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon but he made me feel i was telling him a fabulous story it makes you think there is something magic about history to keep your father s attention in fact im convinced i learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first id be so excited i would blurt out the dodgers won or the dodgers lost which took much of the drama of this two hour telling away,True,True,good,,,,,,
and i was so excited first person id ever see outside of field but it so happened he was speaking in a protestant church when you are brought up as a catholic you think that if you ever set foot in a protestant church youll be struck dead at the threshold so i went to my father in tears what are we going to do he said dont worry he is speaking in a parish hall were sitting in folding chairs he is talking about sportsmanship it is not a sin but as i left that night i was certain that somehow id traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with roy campanella,True,True,good,,,,,,

illustrate this point abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson as for that first sphere of work i think what abraham lincoln s life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it wasnt simply for office or power or celebrity or fame what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hard scrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there,False,False,good,,,,,,
he somehow had to escape that hard scrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or aesop s fables he was so excited he couldnt sleep he couldnt eat the great poet emily dickinson once said there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away how true for lincoln though he never would travel to europe he went with shakespeare s kings to merry england he went with lord byron s poetry to spain and portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings,False,False,good,,,,,,
that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with mary todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend joshua speed was leaving illinois to go back to kentucky because father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal,False,False,good,,,,,,
and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said lincoln you must rally or you will die he said that i would just as soon die right now but ive not yet done anything to make any human being remember that i have lived so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in congress he then ran twice for the senate lost twice everyone is broken by life ernest hemingway once said but some people are stronger in the broken places,False,False,good,,,,,,

now it turns out research tells us that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping from birth we are wired to solve in one study newborns still in the hospital were shown patterns patterns like this circle cross circle cross and then the pattern was changed triangle square and by tracking an infant s gaze we know that newborns as young as a day old can notice and respond to disruptions in order it is remarkable so from infancy through old age the urge to solve unites us all and i even found this photo on of pop star katy perry solving a crossword puzzle with her morning coffee like,True,True,good,,,,,,
you can see my name above the grid im going to give this to you gwen to take a look and i will also put it up on the screen now let us take a look at another piece of the puzzle if you look at the first clue for it starts with the letter c for corrupt and just below that we have an o for outfielder and if you keep reading the first letters of the clues down you get cobalt horse amber owl silver ox red donkey and emerald rooster that is pretty cool right it is the new york times but wait wait wait wait wait oh gwen do you recall how i forgot my purple marker and you were unable to color the sheep well if you keep reading starting with it says oh by the way the sheep can be left blank,True,True,good,,,,,,
and magic i work in what most people think are two distinct fields but i believe they are the same i am both a magician and a new york times crossword puzzle constructor which basically means ive taken the world s two hobbies and combined them into one career and i believe that magic and puzzles are the same because they both key into one of the most important human drives the urge to solve human beings are wired to solve to make order out of chaos it s certainly true for me,False,False,good,,,,,,
certainly true for me ive been solving my whole life high school consisted of epic scrabble matches in the cafeteria and not really talking to girls and then at about that time i started learning magic tricks and definitely not talking to girls there is nothing like starting a conversation with hey did you know that is worth points in scrabble but back then i noticed an intersection between puzzles and illusion when you do the crossword puzzle or when you watch a magic show you become a solver and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos the chaos of say a black puzzle grid a mixed up bag of scrabble tiles or a shuffled pack of playing cards and today as a points and an illusion designer i create that chaos i test your ability to solve,False,False,good,,,,,,
but many other cultures have their signature puzzles as well china gives us which would test abilities to form shapes from the jumbled pieces chaos order,False,False,good,,,,,,

and i want to turn now briefly to talk about that book which ive read youve all got a copy and youve just heard the man and what i want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design standpoint because i think it is actually a brilliant book first of all the goal and you heard just now what the goal is it is to bring purpose to the lives of millions and he has succeeded is it a good goal in itself im sure we all agree it is a wonderful goal he is absolutely right there are lots of people out there who dont have purpose in their life and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal i give him an a on this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
is the goal achieved yes thirty million copies of this book al gore eat your heart out,True,True,good,,,,,,
i dont have to tell you this you just heard the man excellent insights into human psychology wise advice on every page moreover he invites us to look under the hood i really appreciated that for instance he has an appendix where he explains his choice of translations of different bible verses the book is clear vivid accessible beautifully just enough repetition that is really important every time you read it or say it you make another copy in your brain,True,True,good,,,,,,
but of course god got a lot of help this is the ancestor of cattle,False,False,good,,,,,,
now why am i talking about cows because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions religions are natural phenomena theyre just as natural as cows they have evolved over millennia they have a biological base just like the they have become domesticated and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years this is ted and i want to talk about design because what ive been doing for the last four years really since the first time you saw me some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion and in the last four years ive been working just about non stop on this topic and you might say it is about the reverse engineering of religions,False,False,good,,,,,,
because what ive been doing for the last four years really since the first time you saw me some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion and in the last four years ive been working just about non stop on this topic and you might say it is about the reverse engineering of religions now that very idea i think strikes terror in many people or anger or anxiety of one sort or another and that is the spell that i want to break i want to say no religions are an important natural phenomenon we should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena like global warming as we heard so eloquently last night from al gore today s religions are brilliantly designed brilliantly designed they are immensely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering and as with the cow there is a mixture of evolutionary design designed by natural selection itself and intelligent design more or less intelligent design and redesigned by human beings who are trying to redesign their religions,False,False,good,,,,,,
dont do book talks at ted but im going to have just one slide about my book because there is one message in it which i think this group really needs to hear and i would be very interested to get your responses to this it is the one policy proposal that i make in the book at this time when i claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make and it is one that echoes remarks that youve heard already today here s my proposal im going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it education on world religions for all of our children in primary school in high school in public schools in private schools and in home schooling so what im proposing is just as we require reading writing arithmetic american history so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world about their history about their creeds about their texts their music their their prohibitions their requirements and this should be presented factually straightforwardly with no particular spin to all of the children in the country,False,False,good,,,,,,
im delighted to be here im honored by the invitation and thanks i would love to talk about stuff that im interested in but unfortunately i suspect that what im interested in wont interest many other people first off my badge says im an astronomer i would love to talk about my astronomy but i suspect that the number of people who are interested in transfer in non gray and polarization of light in jupiter s upper atmosphere are the number of people whod fit in a bus shelter so im not going to talk about that,True,True,good,,,,,,
i feel that there is a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools my idea is no no get them out of schools and keep them out of schools and id love to talk about this but i think the argument is so obvious to anyone who is hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesnt need much talking about but i guess i may be very wrong about that and everything else that ive said so dont go back and read my dissertation it probably has lies in it as well having said that i outlined my talk about five minutes ago,True,True,good,,,,,,
the d in ted of course stands for design just two weeks ago i made you know ive been making small medium and big klein bottles for the trade but what ive just made and im delighted to show you first time in public here this is a klein bottle wine bottle which although in four dimensions it shouldnt be able to hold any fluid at all it is perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions and because our universe is only three spatial dimensions it can hold fluids so it is highly that one s the cool one that was a month of my life but although i would love to talk about with you im not going to,True,False,bad,,,,,,

the first time you do something it is science the second time it is engineering a third time it is just being a technician im a scientist once i do something i do something else so im not going to talk about that nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book silicon snake oil or my second book nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers dont belong in schools,False,False,good,,,,,,
im supposed to talk about the future yes oh right and my feeling is asking me to talk about the future is bizarre because ive got gray hair and so it is kind of silly for me to talk about the future in fact i think that if you really want to know what the future s going to be if you really want to know about the future dont ask a technologist a scientist a physicist no dont ask somebody who is writing code,False,False,good,,,,,,
no if you want to know what society s going to be like in years ask a kindergarten teacher they know in fact dont ask just any kindergarten teacher ask an experienced one theyre the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation i dont nor i suspect do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring certainly all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there,False,False,good,,,,,,
but that is not what im going to talk about id love to talk about it itd be fun but i want to talk about what im doing now what am i doing now oh the other thing that i think id like to talk about is right over here right over here is that visible what id like to talk about is one sided things i would dearly love to talk about things that have one side because i love mobius loops i not only love mobius loops but im one of the very few people if not the only person in the world that makes klein bottles right away i hope that all of your eyes glaze over,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i brought all that video back into the physical world by printing it out on these long strips of ink jet paper and cutting out the forms now i invented my own form of the which removes the drum and replaces the slits with a video camera and this was very exciting for me because it meant that i could make these physical objects and i could make films from those objects that s me riding on my bicycle,True,False,bad,,,,,,
instead of spending hours a day with my face plastered to a screen i was having these little adventures with our new family and shooting video along the way and it was kind of a symbiosis of art and life and i think that it is no mistake that translates into wheel of life but film and video does flatten sculpture so i tried to imagine a way that animated sculpture could be experienced as such and also a completely kind of animated sculpture and that is where i came up with the idea for the tunnel you walk through with a handheld strobe and wherever you point the flashlight the animation pops to life i plan to finish this project in the next to years,True,True,good,,,,,,
a long time ago i was a professional animator eric dyer animator and at night i would make my own experimental films and i was spending a lot of time way too much time in front of a screen for work that would be presented on a screen and i had this great need to get my hands back on the work again,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i did build a half scale prototype it is covered in velcro and i could lay inside on this bridge and stick animated sequences to the walls and test stuff out people would comment that it reminded them of an and that medical connection spoke to me because at the age of i was diagnosed with a degenerative retinal condition that is slowly taking my vision away and id never responded to that in my work so i responded to it in this piece called implant it is an imaginary super magnified medical device that fits around the optic nerve,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is the norwegian media in a nutshell not much drama a few years back norway s public tv channel decided to broadcast live coverage of a seven hour train ride seven hours of simple footage a train rolling down the tracks norwegians more than a million of them according to the ratings loved it a new kind of reality tv show was born and it goes against all the rules of tv engagement there is no story line no script no drama no climax and it is called slow tv for the past two months norwegians have been watching a cruise ship s journey up the coast and there is a lot of fog on that coast executives at norway s national broadcasting service are now considering broadcasting a night of knitting nationwide on the surface it sounds boring because it is but something about this tv experiment has gripped norwegians so we sent the listening post s marcela pizarro to oslo to find out what it is but first a warning viewers may find some of the images in the following report disappointing,True,True,good,,,,,,
actually it turned out to be seven hours and minutes due to a signal failure at the last station we had four cameras three of them pointing out to the beautiful nature some talking to the guests some information train announcement we will arrive at station th and that is about it but of course also the tunnels gave us the opportunity to do some archives narrator in norwegian then a bit of flirting while the food is digested the last downhill stretch before we reach our destination we pass station then a new tunnel,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it will fit for the train spotters in norway we brought it on air in november but no this was far more attractive this is the five biggest tv channels in norway on a normal friday and if you look at over here look what happened when they put on the bergen railway show million norwegians watched part of this program and another funny thing when the host on our main channel after they have got news for you she said and on our second channel the train has now nearly reached station thousands of people just jumped on the train on our second channel like this,True,True,good,,,,,,
so this is not the first time had been on board a ship this is back in when the technical managers have suits and ties and rolled all its equipment on board a ship and meters out of the shore transmitting the signal back and in the machine room they talked to the machine guy and on the deck they have splendid entertainment so being on a ship it is not the first time but five and a half days in a row and live we wanted some help and we asked our viewers out there what do you want to see what do you want us to film how do you want this to look do you want us to make a website what do you want on it and we got some answers from you out there and it helped us a very lot to build the program so in june of us went on board the coastal ship and we set off i have some really strong memories from that week and it is all about people this guy for instance he is head of research at the university in and i will show you a piece of cloth this one,True,False,bad,,,,,,
narrator in norwegian run it up and down this is norway s most important drill right now it regulates the height of a bow camera in live production one of that capture great shots from the ms nord norge eight wires keep the camera stable cameraman i work on different camera solutions theyre just tools used in a different context another camera is this one it is normally used for sports it made it possible for us to take close up pictures of people away like this one,True,True,good,,,,,,
but it is a long program so some watched part of it like the prime minister some watched a little bit more it says i havent used my bed for five days and he is years old and he hardly slept he kept watching because something might happen though it probably wont,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this is the last project it is the peep show it is hours of on a tv screen actually days on the web we have made hours of live salmon fishing it actually took three hours before we got the first fish and that is quite slow we have made hours of boat ride into the beautiful canal and we have made another train ride with the northern railway and because this we couldnt do live we did it in four seasons just to give the viewer another experience on the way so our next project got us some attention outside norway this is from the colbert report on comedy central ive got my eye on a wildly popular program from norway called national firewood night which consisted of mostly people in parkas chatting and chopping in the woods and then eight hours of a fire burning in a fireplace,True,True,good,,,,,,
and get this almost percent of the norwegian population tuned in percent so when wood fire and wood chopping can be that interesting why not knitting so on our next project we used more than eight hours to go live from a sheep to a sweater and jimmy kimmel in the show he liked that jimmy kimmel even the people on the show are falling asleep and after all that the actually failed to break the world record they did not succeed but remember the old norwegian saying it is not whether you win or lose that counts in fact nothing counts and death is coming for us all,True,True,good,,,,,,
i have only got minutes to explain something that lasts for hours and days so id better get started let us start with a clip from al listening post norway is a country that gets relatively little media coverage even the elections this past week passed without much drama and that is the norwegian media in a nutshell not much drama,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then follows an eight minute story on al about some strange tv programs in little norway al cnn how did we get there we have to go back to when one of my colleagues got a great idea where do you get your ideas in the lunchroom,False,False,good,,,,,,
it was so nice to see all the thousands of and users discussing the same view talking to each other as if they were on the same train together and especially i like this one it is a old man he is watched all the program and at the end station he rises up to pick up what he thinks is his luggage and his head hit the curtain rod and he realized he is in his own living room so that is strong and living tv,False,False,good,,,,,,
so that is strong and living tv four hundred and thirty six minute by minute on a friday night and during that first night the first message came why be a chicken why stop at when you can expand that to minute by minute and do the journey in norway the coastal ship journey from bergen to almost kilometers covering most of our coast it has old very interesting history and literally takes part in life and death along the coast so just a week after the bergen railway we called the company and we started planning for our next show we wanted to do something different the bergen railway was a recorded program so when we sat in our editing room we watched this picture it is all l station we saw this journalist,False,False,good,,,,,,
did we do this yes we took a conference room on board the we turned it into a complete tv control room we made it all work of course and then we took along cameras this is one of them this is my sketch from february and when you give this sketch to professional people in the norwegian broadcasting company you get some cool stuff back,False,False,good,,,,,,
everything went well we also could take pictures of people waving at us people along the thousands of them and they all had a phone in their hand and when you take a picture of them and they get the message now we are on tv dad they start waving back this was waving tv for five and a half days and people get so extremely happy when they can send a warm message to their loved ones it was also a great success on social media,False,False,good,,,,,,
so why does this stand out this is so completely different to other tv programming we take the viewer on a journey that happens right now in real time and the viewer gets the feeling of actually being there actually being on the train on the boat and knitting together with others and the reason i think why theyre doing that is because we dont edit the timeline it is important that we dont edit the timeline and it is also important that what we make slow tv about is something that we all can relate to that the viewer can relate to and that somehow has a root in our culture this is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is important that we dont edit the timeline and it is also important that what we make slow tv about is something that we all can relate to that the viewer can relate to and that somehow has a root in our culture this is a picture from last summer when we traveled the coast again for seven weeks and of course this is a lot of planning this is a lot of logistics so this is the working plan for people last summer but more important is what you dont plan you dont plan what is going to happen you have to just take your cameras with you it is like a sports event you rig them and you see what is happening so this is actually the whole running order for hours just written on one page,False,False,good,,,,,,
humans have pigs have even bacteria and some viruses have too the genetic instructions encoded in inform how our bodies develop grow function and in many cases that same information can trigger disease your genetic information is strung into a long and twisted molecule the double helix that has over three billion letters beginning to end but the lines that carry meaningful information are usually very short a few dozen to several thousand letters long so when were looking to answer a question based on we actually dont need to read all those three billion letters typically that would be like getting hungry at night and having to flip through the whole phone book from cover to cover pausing at every line just to find the nearest pizza joint,True,True,good,,,,,,
you would have thought wow i can now call my aunt glenda from the car and wish her a happy birthday i can call anyone anytime this is the future little did you know you would tap on that phone to make dinner reservations for you and aunt glenda to celebrate together with another tap youd be ordering her gift and yet one more tap and youd be liking auntie glenda on and all of this while sitting on the toilet,True,True,good,,,,,,
we see him pictured here holding the first cultivated truffle in his hands on one of his farms truffles are this delicacy that stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees and it is a rare fungus some species may fetch or more dollars per kilogram i learned from paul that the stakes for a truffle farmer can be really high when he sources new truffles to grow on his farms he is exposed to the threat of knockoffs truffles that look and feel like the real thing but theyre of lower quality but even to a trained eye like paul s even when looked at under a microscope these truffles can pass for authentic so in order to grow the highest quality truffles the ones that chefs all over the world will fight over paul has to use analysis isnt that mind blowing i bet you will never look at that black truffle again without thinking of its genes,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this is not a family made of scientists this is a family like any other they just like to spend time together doing fun creative things by day brian is an executive at a private equity firm at night and on weekends he experiments with alongside his kids ages seven and nine as a way to explore the living world last time i called them they were checking out homegrown produce from the backyard garden they were testing tomatoes that they had picked taking the flesh of their skin putting it in a test tube mixing it with chemicals to extract and then using their home copier to test those tomatoes for genetically engineered traits for the daniels family the personal machine is like the chemistry set for the century most of us may not yet be diagnosing genetic conditions in our kitchen sinks or doing at home paternity testing,True,True,good,,,,,,
but weve definitely reached a point in history where every one of you could actually get hands on with in your kitchen you could copy paste and analyze and extract meaningful information from it and it is at times like this that profound transformation is bound to happen moments when a powerful technology that was before limited to a select few in the ivory tower finally becomes within the reach of every one of us from farmers to schoolchildren think about the moment when phones stopped being plugged into the wall by cords or when computers left the mainframe and entered your home or your office the ripples of the personal revolution may be hard to predict but one thing is certain revolutions dont go backwards and technology is already spreading faster than our imagination so if youre curious get up close and personal with today it is in our to be curious,True,False,bad,,,,,,
living in tight quarters one pig coughing and sneezing may soon lead to the next pig coughing and sneezing until an outbreak of swine flu has taken over your farm if it is a bad enough virus the health of your herd may be gone in the blink of an eye if you called in a veterinarian he or she would visit your farm and take samples from your noses and mouths but then they would have to drive back into the city to test those samples in their central lab two weeks later youd hear back the results two weeks may be just enough time for infection to spread and take away your way of life but it doesnt have to be that way today farmers can take those samples themselves they can jump right into the pen and swab their noses and mouths with a little filter paper place that little filter paper in a tiny tube and mix it with some chemicals that will extract genetic material from their noses and mouths,False,False,good,,,,,,
today farmers can take those samples themselves they can jump right into the pen and swab their noses and mouths with a little filter paper place that little filter paper in a tiny tube and mix it with some chemicals that will extract genetic material from their noses and mouths and without leaving their farms they take a drop of that genetic material and put it into a little analyzer smaller than a shoebox program it to detect or from the swine flu virus and within one hour get back the results visualize the results this reality is possible because today were living in the era of personal technology every one of us can actually test ourselves is the fundamental molecule the carries genetic instructions that help build the living world humans have pigs have even bacteria and some viruses have too,False,False,good,,,,,,
even judges use the output of these machines in court to decide whether someone is innocent or guilty based on evidence the inventor of this copying technique was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in but for years the power of genetic analysis has been confined to the ivory tower or bigwig scientist work well several companies around the world are working on making this same technology accessible to everyday people like the pig farmer like you,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is notoriously hard to predict where new technology might take us and the same is true for personal technology today for example i could never have imagined that a truffle farmer of all people would use personal machines dr paul thomas grows truffles for a living we see him pictured here holding the first cultivated truffle in his hands on one of his farms truffles are this delicacy that stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees,False,False,good,,,,,,
but personal machines can also save human lives professor ian goodfellow is a virologist at the university of cambridge last year he traveled to sierra leone when the ebola outbreak broke out in western africa he quickly realized that doctors there lacked the basic tools to detect and combat disease results could take up to a week to come back that is way too long for the patients and the families who are suffering ian decided to move his lab into sierra leone,False,False,good,,,,,,
results could take up to a week to come back that is way too long for the patients and the families who are suffering ian decided to move his lab into sierra leone here we see ian goodfellow moving over tons of equipment into a pop up tent that he would equip to detect and diagnose the virus and sequence it within hours but here s a surprise the same equipment that ian could use at his lab in the to sequence and diagnose ebola just wouldnt work under these conditions were talking celsius heat and over percent humidity here but instead ian could use personal machines small enough to be placed in front of the air conditioning unit to keep sequencing the virus and keep saving lives this may seem like an extreme place for analysis but let us move on to an even more extreme environment outer space let us talk about analysis in space when astronauts live aboard the international space station theyre orbiting the planet miles high,False,False,good,,,,,,
i was years old i was a kid and he said to me i remember this like yesterday he was a great guy but he said to me kid go to school or go open a falafel stand were not really interested in these kinds of new adventures were not interested in your help and he threw me out of the room i dont need your help he said i was a very stubborn kid as you see now im walking around like crazy,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this is an this is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency it has everything an ambulance has except for a bed you see the defibrillator you see the equipment we all saw the tragedy that happened in boston,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they have dedicated their lives to it and just to give you an idea they have spent million over years it is very harsh conditions they work on a shoestring budget the toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack and it is that basic but they do this every year from siberia to the desert in chile to see something called the very large telescope the very large telescope is one of these things that astronomers do they name their telescopes rather i can tell you for a fact that the next one that theyre planning is called the extremely large telescope,True,True,good,,,,,,
i would like to talk today about what i think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it my own interest in this subject and my passion for it began rather accidentally i had bought a copy of this book the universe and dr einstein a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in seattle a few years after that in bangalore i was finding it hard to fall asleep one night and i picked up this book thinking it would put me to sleep in minutes and as it happened i read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot and i was left with this intense feeling of awe and exhilaration at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do,False,False,good,,,,,,
youre seeing on the right is the design of the library specifically in terms of square footage on the left of that diagram here youll see a series of five platforms sort of combs collective programs and on the right are the more indeterminate spaces things like reading rooms whose evolution in years we cant predict so that literally was the design of the building they signed it and to their chagrin we came back a week later and we presented them this and as you can see it is literally the diagram on the right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so you see the five platforms those are the boxes within each one a very discrete thing is happening the area in between is sort of an urban continuum these things that we cant predict their evolution to the same degree to give you some sense of the power of this idea the biggest block is what we call the book spiral it is literally built in a very inexpensive way it is a parking garage for books it just so happens to be on the through floors of the building but that is not necessarily an expensive approach and it allows us to organize the entire dewey decimal system on one continuous run no matter how it grows or contracts within the building it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears that weve all experienced in public libraries,True,True,good,,,,,,
this is actually a program that we invented with the library it was recognizing that public libraries are the last vestige of public free space there are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain in downtown seattle but there are not so many free places that allow you to get out of the rain so this was an area where people could pretty much do anything including eat yell play chess and so forth now were moving up into what we call the mixing chamber that was the main technology area in the building youll have to tell me if im going too fast for you and now up this is actually the place that we put into the building so i could propose to my wife right there,True,False,bad,,,,,,
first the physical constraints we actually had to operate on three discrete sites all of them well smaller than the size of the building we had to operate next to the new muhammad ali center and respect it we had to operate within the floodplain now this area floods three to four times a year and there is a levee behind our site similar to the ones that broke in new orleans had to operate behind the corridor a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites so were starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub underneath the bathtub are the city s main power lines and there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add that would link a series of cultural buildings and a view corridor because this is the historic district that they didnt want to obstruct with a new building,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and now were going to add million square feet and if we did the traditional thing that million square feet these are the different programs the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements place them on sites and now wed have a really terrible situation a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods and then we would size all the other elements the different commercial elements hotel luxury housing offices and so forth and dump it on top and we would create something that was in fact and you know this this is called the time warner building,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and it concludes in something that you see here that you actually wouldnt expect as being the result of rationality,False,False,good,,,,,,
the second the second is that this process does not have a signature there is no authorship architects are obsessed with authorship this is something that has editing and it has teams but in fact we no longer see within this process the traditional master architect creating a sketch that his minions carry out and the third is that it challenges and this is in the length of this very hard to support why connect all these things but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility high modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic almost anything can happen within them i call it sort of shotgun flexibility turn your head this way shoot and youre bound to kill something,False,False,good,,,,,,
high modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic almost anything can happen within them i call it sort of shotgun flexibility turn your head this way shoot and youre bound to kill something so this is the promise of high modernism within a single space actually any kind of activity can happen but as were seeing operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs in terms of design parameters and so with this sort of idea what happens is whatever actually is in the building on opening day or whatever seems to be the most immediate need starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of it of anything else could ever happen and so were proposing a different kind of flexibility something that we call compartmentalized flexibility and the idea is that you within that continuum identify a series of points and you design specifically to them they can be pushed off center a little bit but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped with high modernist flexibility that doesnt really work,False,False,good,,,,,,
to talk about im going to build up the seattle central library in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams and i truly mean this is the design process that youll see with the library staff and the library board we settled on two core positions this is the first one and this is showing over the last years the evolution of the book and other technologies this diagram was our sort of position piece about the book and our position was books are technology that is something people forget but it is a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media the second premise and this was something that was very difficult for us to convince the librarians of at first is that libraries since the inception of carnegie library tradition in america had a second responsibility and that was for social roles ok now this ill come back to later but something actually the librarians at first said no this isnt our mandate our mandate is media and particularly the book,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what youre seeing now is actually the design of the building the upper diagram is what we had seen in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility sort of any activity could happen anywhere we dont know the future of the library we dont know the future of the book and so well use this approach and what we saw were buildings that were very generic and worse not only were they very generic so not only does the reading room look like the copy room look like the magazine area but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it and in this case what was getting engulfed were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book and so we proposed what is at the lower diagram,False,False,good,,,,,,
he wasnt content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal he threw it all out there that did end up with vulnerable people in afghanistan being exposed it also meant that the dictator was given a handy list of all the pro democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the u s government is that radical openness i say it is not because for me what it means it doesnt mean abdicating power responsibility accountability it is actually being a partner with power it is about sharing responsibility sharing accountability also the fact that he threatened to sue me because i got a leak of his leaks i thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology to be honest as well,True,True,good,,,,,,
so what is the solution it is i believe to embody within the rule of law rights to information at the moment our rights are incredibly weak in a lot of countries we have official secrets acts including in britain here we have an official secrets act with no public interest test so that means it is a crime people are punished quite severely in a lot of cases for publishing or giving away official information now wouldnt it be amazing and really this is what i want all of you to think about if we had an official disclosure act where officials were punished if they were found to have suppressed or hidden information that was in the public interest so that yes yes my power pose i would like us to work towards that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
theyve locked all the doors theyve kidded out the house with cameras theyre watching all of us theyve dug a basement and theyve built a spy center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are troublesome and if any of us complain about that were arrested for terrorism well is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare some fairy tales have happy endings some dont i think weve all read the fairy tales which are indeed very grim but the world isnt a fairy tale and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge equally it could be better than weve been led to believe but either way we have to start seeing it exactly as it is with all of its problems because it is only by seeing it with all of its problems that well be able to fix them and live in a world in which we can all be happily ever after,True,False,bad,,,,,,
a time the world was a big dysfunctional family it was run by the great and powerful parents and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children if any of the more children questioned the authority of the parents they were scolded if they went exploring into the parents rooms or even into the secret filing cabinets they were punished and told that for their own good they must never go in there again then one day a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents rooms look what theyve been hiding from you he said,False,False,good,,,,,,
then one day a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents rooms look what theyve been hiding from you he said the children looked and were amazed there were maps and minutes from meetings where the parents were each other off they behaved just like the children and they made mistakes too just like the children the only difference was their mistakes were in the secret filing cabinets well there was a girl in the town and she didnt think they should be in the secret filing cabinets or if they were there ought to be a law to allow the children access and so she set about to make it so,False,False,good,,,,,,
well im the girl in that story and the secret documents that i was interested in were located in this building the british parliament and the data that i wanted to get my hands on were the expense receipts of members of parliament i thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy it wasnt like i was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker or anything like that but the amount of resistance i got from this freedom of information request you would have thought id asked something like this so i fought for about five years doing this and it was one of many hundreds of requests that i made not i didnt hey look i didnt set out honestly to revolutionize the british parliament that was not my intention i was just making these requests as part of research for my first book but it ended up in this very long protracted legal battle and there i was after five years fighting against parliament in front of three of britain s most eminent high court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not parliament had to release this data,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what id like to talk about is something that was very dear to kahn s heart which is how do we discover what is really particular about a project how do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place and the uniqueness of a program in a building and so ill take you to wichita kansas where i was asked some years ago to do a science museum on a site right downtown by the river and i thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river part of the river unfortunately though the site was separated from the river by mclean boulevard so i suggested let us reroute mclean and that gave birth instantly to friends of mclean boulevard,True,True,good,,,,,,
and so the process began and they said you cant put it all on an island some of it has to be on the mainland because we dont want to turn our back to the community and there emerged a design the galleries sort of forming an island and you could walk through them or on the roof and there were all kinds of exciting features you could come in through the buildings walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape if you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced come back and pay the five dollars admission,True,True,good,,,,,,
so you know it is one of those things that you dont take too seriously but two weeks later i was in this little town outside the capital of the punjab and the temple and also next to it the fortress that the last guru of the sikhs guru died in as he wrote the khalsa which is their holy scripture and i got to work and they took me somewhere down there nine kilometers away from the town and the temple and said that is where we have chosen the location and i said this just doesnt make any sense the pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands theyre not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there let us get back to the town and walk to the site and i recommended they do it right there on that hill and this hill and bridge all the way into the town and as things are a little easier in india the site was purchased within a week and we were working,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and there it is under construction there are workers at work and it will be finished in two years back to three years ago after all this episode began decided to rebuild completely the historic museum because now washington was built the holocaust museum in washington and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information and needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point they said let us rebuild the museum but of course the sikhs might give you a job on a platter the jews make it hard international competition phase one phase two phase three,True,True,good,,,,,,
a for those who dont know is the surface of a doughnut or for some of us a bagel and out of this idea started spinning off many many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits and you see the intersection of the plan with the geometry,False,False,good,,,,,,
and finally the building this is the model and when there were complaints about budget i said well it is worth doing the island because you get twice for your money reflections and here s the building as it opened with a channel overlooking downtown and as seen from downtown and the bike going right through the building so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building the geometry made for a very efficient building every beam in this building is the same radius all laminated wood every wall every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building every piece of the building works,False,False,good,,,,,,
this voice does not repeat for six months and then you descend to light and to the north and to life,False,False,good,,,,,,
well they said people wont understand theyll think it is a discotheque you cant do that and they shelved the project and it sat there for years and then one day abe spiegel from los angeles who had lost his three son at auschwitz came saw the model wrote the check and it got built years later so many years after that in i was on one of my monthly trips to jerusalem and i got a call from the foreign ministry saying weve got the chief minister of the punjab here he is on a state visit we took him on a visit to we took him to the children s memorial he was extremely moved,False,False,good,,,,,,
so many years after that in i was on one of my monthly trips to jerusalem and i got a call from the foreign ministry saying weve got the chief minister of the punjab here he is on a state visit we took him on a visit to we took him to the children s memorial he was extremely moved he is demanding to meet the architect could you come down and meet him in tel aviv and i went down and chief minister badal said to me we sikhs have suffered a great deal as you have jews i was very moved by what i saw today we are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people were about to embark on that id like you to come and design it and so you know it is one of those things that you dont take too seriously,False,False,good,,,,,,
and watched a real surgery i had no idea what to expect i was a college student in engineering i thought it was going to be like on tv ominous music playing in the background beads of sweat pouring down the surgeon s face but it wasnt like that at all there was music playing on this day i think it was madonna s greatest hits,True,True,good,,,,,,
so let us take a look at some of the devices that are used in these types of procedures i mentioned this is an epidural needle it is used to puncture through the ligaments in the spine and deliver anesthesia during childbirth here s a set of bone marrow biopsy tools these are actually used to burrow into the bone and collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions here s a from the civil war,True,True,good,,,,,,
and then inserts these long thin instruments and a camera and actually does the procedure inside the patient,False,False,good,,,,,,
right every single time you did this you experienced the same fundamental physics that i was watching in the operating room that day and it turns out it really is a problem in the actually came out and said that incisions might be the most dangerous step in minimally invasive surgery again in we see a paper that says that account for over half of all major complications in laparoscopic surgery and oh by the way this hasnt changed for years so when i got to graduate school this is what i wanted to work on,False,False,good,,,,,,
because what is the difference so the more i did this research the more i thought there has to be a better way to do this and for me the key to this problem is that all these different puncture devices share a common set of fundamental physics so what are those physics let us go back to drilling through a wall so youre applying a force on a drill towards the wall,False,False,good,,,,,,
this story begins in when at age i became the world chess champion after beating anatoly karpov earlier that year i played what is called simultaneous exhibition against of the world s best chess playing machines in hamburg germany i won all the games and then it was not considered much of a surprise that i could beat computers at the same time to me that was the golden age,True,False,bad,,,,,,
just years later i was fighting for my life against just one computer in a match called by the cover of newsweek the brain s last stand no pressure,True,True,good,,,,,,

deep blue was victorious but was it intelligent no no it wasnt at least not in the way alan turing and other founders of computer science had hoped it turned out that chess could be crunched by brute force once hardware got fast enough and algorithms got smart enough although by the definition of the output grandmaster level chess deep blue was intelligent but even at the incredible speed million positions per second deep blue s method provided little of the dreamed of insight into the mysteries of human intelligence soon machines will be taxi drivers and doctors and professors but will they be intelligent i would rather leave these definitions to the philosophers and to the dictionary what really matters is how we humans feel about living and working with these machines when i first met deep blue in in february i had been the world champion for more than years and i had played world championship games and hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions,False,False,good,,,,,,
what about the electronic revolution here s an early computer it is amazing the mainframe computer was invented in by we had telephone bills bank statements were being produced by computers the earliest cell phones the earliest personal computers were invented in the the brought us bill gates dos machines to replace bank tellers bar code scanning to cut down on labor in the retail sector fast forward through the we had the revolution and a temporary rise in productivity growth but im now going to give you an experiment you have to choose either option a or option b,True,True,good,,,,,,
i dont know why but im continually amazed to think that two and a half billion of us around the world are connected to each other through the internet and that at any point in time more than percent of the world s population can go online to learn to create and to share and the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this is also continuing to go grow a recent study showed that the young generation alone is spending over eight hours a day online as the parent of a nine girl that number seems awfully low,True,True,good,,,,,,
this is a nine girl navigating to principally children s sites i move from this from freaked out to enraged this is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate this is me being a parent imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement i can tell you there isnt a person in this room that would sit idly by wed take action it may not be good action but we would take action,True,True,good,,,,,,
and with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen we are like hansel and gretel leaving of our personal information everywhere we travel through the digital woods we are leaving our birthdays our places of residence our interests and preferences our relationships our financial histories and on and on it goes now dont get me wrong im not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
now dont get me wrong im not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing in fact when i know the data that is being shared and im asked explicitly for my consent i want some sites to understand my habits it helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with but when i dont know and when i havent been asked that is when the problem arises it is a phenomenon on the internet today called behavioral tracking and it is very big business in fact there is an entire industry formed around following us through the digital woods and compiling a profile on each of us and when all of that data is held they can do almost whatever they want with it this is an area today that has very few regulations and even fewer rules,False,False,good,,,,,,
pitch black outside my old son is fast asleep in his bed sleeping the reckless deep sleep of a teenager i flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake because i know that like ripping off a band aid it is better to get it over with quickly,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i also know that by waking him up hours before his natural biological clock tells him he is ready im literally robbing him of his dreams the type of sleep most associated with learning memory consolidation and emotional processing but it is not just my kid that is being deprived of sleep sleep deprivation among american teenagers is an epidemic only about one in gets the eight to hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians,False,False,good,,,,,,
sleep deprivation among american teenagers is an epidemic only about one in gets the eight to hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians now if youre thinking to yourself phew were doing good my kid s getting eight hours remember eight hours is the minimum recommendation youre barely passing eight hours is kind of like getting a c on your report card there are many factors contributing to this epidemic but a major factor preventing teens from getting the sleep they need is actually a matter of public policy not hormones social lives or across the country many schools are starting around or earlier despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend that middle and high school start no earlier than these early start policies have a direct effect on how much or really how little sleep american teenagers are getting,False,False,good,,,,,,
i loved dance lola alvin ailey jerome robbins and i also avidly followed the gemini and the apollo programs i had science projects and tons of astronomy books i took calculus and philosophy i wondered about the infinity and the big bang theory and when i was at stanford i found myself my senior year chemical engineering major half the folks thought i was a political science and performing arts major which was sort of true because i was black student union president and i did major in some other things and i found myself the last quarter juggling chemical engineering separation processes logic classes nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and also producing and choreographing a dance production and i had to do the lighting and the design work and i was trying to figure out do i go to new york city to try to become a professional dancer or do i go to medical school now my mother helped me figure that one out,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and yeah sub atomic physics is you literally try to tear atoms apart to understand what is inside of them but sculpture from what i understand from great sculptors is because you see a piece and you remove what doesnt need to be there biotechnology is constructive orchestral arranging is constructive so in fact we use constructive and techniques in everything the difference between science and the arts is not that they are different sides of the same coin even or even different parts of the same continuum but rather theyre manifestations of the same thing different quantum states of an atom or maybe if i want to be more century i could say that they are different harmonic of a but well leave that alone,True,False,bad,,,,,,
you know people say intuitive you know that is like youre in touch with nature in touch with yourself and relationships analytical you put your mind to work and im going to tell you a little secret you all know this though but sometimes people use this analysis idea that things are outside of ourselves to be say that this is what were going to elevate as the true most important sciences right and then you have artists and you all know this is true as well artists will say things about scientists because they say theyre too concrete theyre disconnected with the world but weve even had that here on stage so dont act like you dont know what im talking about,True,False,bad,,,,,,
is to spend some time talking about some stuff that is sort of giving me a little bit of existential angst for lack of a better word over the past couple of years and basically these three quotes tell what is going on when god made the color purple god was just showing off alice walker wrote in the color purple and zora neale hurston wrote in dust tracks on a road research is a formalized curiosity it is poking and prying with a purpose and then finally when i think about the near future you know we have this attitude well whatever happens happens right so that goes along with the cat saying if you dont care much where you want to get to it doesnt much matter which way you go but i think it does matter which way we go and what road we take because when i think about design in the near future what i think are the most important issues what is really crucial and vital is that we need to revitalize the arts and sciences right now in if we describe the near future as years from now that means that what we do today is going to be critically important because in the year and the year the world our society is going to be building on the basic knowledge and abstract ideas the discoveries that we came up with today just as all these wonderful things were hearing about here at the ted conference that we take for granted in the world right now were really knowledge and ideas that came up in the the and the that is the substrate that were exploiting today whether it is the internet genetic engineering laser scanners guided missiles fiber optics high definition television sensing remote sensing from space and the wonderful remote sensing photos that we see in weaving tv programs like tracker and enterprise cd rewrite drives alvin suite otis or sarah jones your revolution will not be between these thighs which by the way was banned by the or all of these things without question almost without exception are really based on ideas and abstract and creativity from years before so we have to ask ourselves what are we contributing to that legacy right now and when i think about it im really worried to be quite frank im concerned,False,False,good,,,,,,
take all this advice with a grain of salt im tulley im a contract computer scientist by trade but im the founder of something called the tinkering school it is a summer program which aims to help kids learn how to build the things that they think of so we build a lot of things and i do put power tools into the hands of second graders so if youre thinking about sending your kid to tinkering school they do come back bruised scraped and bloody,True,False,bad,,,,,,
you know we live in a world that is subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations there doesnt seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get we put suffocation warnings on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the united states or for sale with an item in the united states we put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot and we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of so where does this trend stop when we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object every pokey bit in the world then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp or not made out of round plastic theyll hurt themselves with it so as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world around them and despite all of our best efforts and intentions kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can in whatever environment they can,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so despite the provocative title this presentation is really about safety and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be creative confident and in control of the environment around them and what i now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress the book is called dangerous things this is five dangerous things thing number one play with fire learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child s personal history,False,False,good,,,,,,
your first is like the first universal tool that youre given you know it is a spatula it is a pry bar it is a screwdriver and it is a blade yeah and it is a powerful and empowering tool and in a lot of cultures they give knives like as soon as theyre toddlers they have knives these are inuit children cutting whale blubber i first saw this in a canadian film board film when i was and it left a lasting impression to see babies playing with knives,False,False,good,,,,,,
now if there is no best option if the scales dont tip in favor of one alternative over another then surely the alternatives must be equally good so maybe the right thing to say in hard choices is that theyre between equally good options but that cant be right if alternatives are equally good you should just flip a coin between them and it seems a mistake to think here s how you should decide between careers places to live people to marry flip a coin there is another reason for thinking that hard choices arent choices between equally good options suppose you have a choice between two jobs you could be an investment banker or a graphic artist there are a variety of things that matter in such a choice like the excitement of the work achieving financial security having time to raise a family and so on maybe the artist s career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of pictorial expression maybe the banking career puts you on the cutting edge of new forms of financial manipulation,True,False,bad,,,,,,
nuts to believe that the reasons given to you dictated that you had most reason to pursue the exact hobbies you do to live in the exact house you do to work at the exact job you do instead you faced alternatives that were on a par hard choices and you made reasons for yourself to choose that hobby that house and that job when alternatives are on a par the reasons given to us the ones that determine whether were making a mistake are silent as to what to do it is here in the space of hard choices that we get to exercise our normative power the power to create reasons for yourself to make yourself into the kind of person for whom country living is preferable to the urban life when we choose between options that are on a par we can do something really rather remarkable we can put our very selves behind an option here s where i stand here s who i am i am for banking i am for chocolate donuts,True,True,good,,,,,,
or it might be a choice about whether to have children to have an ailing parent move in with you to raise your child in a religion that your partner lives by but leaves you cold or whether to donate your life savings to charity chances are the hard choice you thought of was something big something momentous something that matters to you hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing hand wringing the gnashing of teeth,False,False,good,,,,,,
chances are the hard choice you thought of was something big something momentous something that matters to you hard choices seem to be occasions for agonizing hand wringing the gnashing of teeth but i think weve misunderstood hard choices and the role they play in our lives understanding hard choices uncovers a hidden power each of us possesses what makes a choice hard is the way the alternatives relate in any easy choice one alternative is better than the other in a hard choice one alternative is better in some ways the other alternative is better in other ways and neither is better than the other overall you agonize over whether to stay in your current job in the city or uproot your life for more challenging work in the country because staying is better in some ways moving is better in others and neither is better than the other overall we shouldnt think that all hard choices are big,False,False,good,,,,,,

ive actually been waiting by the phone for a call from ted for years and in fact in i was ready to talk about but no call in i was ready to do a talk about the foundation and social entrepreneurship no call in i started participant productions and we had a really good first year and no call and finally i get a call last year and then i have to go up after j j abrams,True,True,good,,,,,,
when i first moved to hollywood from silicon valley i had some misgivings but i found that there were some advantages to being in hollywood,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i also found that hollywood and silicon valley have a lot more in common than i would have dreamed hollywood has its sex symbols and the valley has its sex symbols,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i then had a bit of a wake up call when i was and my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer and it looked pretty bad and what he said was he wasnt so much afraid that he might die but that he hadnt done the things that he wanted to with his life and knock on wood he is still alive today many years later but for a young man that made a real impression on me that one never knows how much time one really has so i set out in a hurry i studied engineering i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom one of those businesses was a computer rental business called micros on the move which is very well named because people kept stealing the computers,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and while i was there i made friends with a fellow named pierre who is here today and pierre i apologize for this this is a photo from the old days and just after id graduated pierre came to me with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other and with the wisdom of my stanford degree i said pierre what a stupid idea,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and it was this last part of the mission the celebrate part that really got me back to thinking when i was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all and a light bulb went off which was first that i didnt actually have to do the writing myself i could find writers and then the next light bulb was better than just writing what about film and tv to get out to people in a big way and i thought about the films that inspired me films like gandhi and schindler s list and i wondered who was doing these kinds of films today and there really wasnt a specific company that was focused on the public interest so in i started to make my way around los angeles to talk about the idea of a pro social media company and i was met with a lot of encouragement one of the lines of encouragement that i heard over and over was the streets of hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you who think youre going to come to this town and make movies and then of course there was the other adage the surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business,True,False,bad,,,,,,
know there is another adage in hollywood that nobody knows nothing about anything and i really thought this was going to be a straight charitable initiative and so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest and today is mandatory viewing in schools in england and scotland and most of scandinavia weve sent to high school teachers in the u s and it is really changed the debate on global warming it was also a pretty good year for this guy we now call al the george clooney of global warming,True,True,good,,,,,,
closing id like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way and all the people in this room have done so through their business lives or their philanthropic work or their other interests and one thing that ive learned is that there is never one right way to make change one can do it as a tech person or as a finance person or a nonprofit person or as an entertainment person but every one of us is all of those things and more and i believe if we do these things we can close the opportunity gaps we can close the hope gaps and i can imagine if we do this the headlines in years might read something like these new aids cases in africa fall to zero u s imports its last barrel of oil israelis and palestinians celebrate years of peaceful coexistence and i like this one snow has returned to kilimanjaro,True,False,bad,,,,,,
when chris invited me to speak he said people think of you as a bit of an enigma and they want to know what drives you a bit and what really drives me is a vision of the future that i think we all share,False,False,good,,,,,,
and what really drives me is a vision of the future that i think we all share it is a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability and when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days ed wilson and the pictures of james i think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that i like to call humanity and it is also something that resides in each of us to close what i think are the two big calamities in the world today one is the gap in opportunity this gap that president clinton last night called uneven unfair and unsustainable and out of that comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us but perhaps the other bigger gap is what we call the hope gap and someone at some point came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldnt make a difference in the world and i think that is just a horrible thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
and someone at some point came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual couldnt make a difference in the world and i think that is just a horrible thing and so chapter one really begins today with all of us because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps and if the men and women of ted cant make a difference in the world i dont know who can and for me a lot of this started when i was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate new york and there really wasnt much to do there for the summer except get beaten up by my sister or read books and so i used to read authors like james michener and james and ayn rand and their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place and it struck me that if i could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected that maybe i could get people interested in the issues that affected us all and maybe engage them to make a difference,False,False,good,,,,,,
but for me personally it was a real change i went from living in a house with five guys in palo alto and living off their leftovers to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources,False,False,good,,,,,,
bet on good people doing good things and that really resonated with me,False,False,good,,,,,,
to bet on these good people doing good things these leading innovative nonprofit folks who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems people today we call social entrepreneurs and to put a face on it people like muhammad who started the bank has lifted million people plus out of poverty around the world won the nobel peace prize but there is also a lot of people that you dont know folks like ann cotton who started a group called in africa because she felt girls education was lagging and she started it about years ago and today she educates over a quarter million african girls,False,False,good,,,,,,
and she started it about years ago and today she educates over a quarter million african girls and somebody like dr victoria hale who started the world s first nonprofit pharmaceutical company and whose first drug will be fighting visceral also known as black fever and by she hopes to eliminate this disease which is really a scourge in the developing world and so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things and a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that i find really is powerful it is what we call invest connect and celebrate and invest if you see good people doing good things invest in them invest in their organizations or in business,False,False,good,,,,,,
in we launched our first slate of films murder ball north country and good night and good luck and much to my surprise they were noticed,False,False,good,,,,,,
now i wasnt really surprised because that is an attitude that ive seen continuously all my life as a theater maker we are told that divine knowledge comes down through the masculine whether it be to the imam the priest the rabbi the holy man similarly were told that creative genius resides in the masculine that it is the masculine that will be able to tell us about who we really are that the masculine will tell the universal story on behalf of all of us whereas women artists will really just talk about women s experiences women s issues only really relevant to women and of passing interest to men and really only some men and it is that conviction that that we are taught that i think colors so much of whether were prepared to believe that women s stories really matter and unless were prepared to believe that women s stories really matter then women s rights dont really matter and then change cant really come i want to tell you about two examples of stories that are thought to be of universal importance e t and hamlet,True,True,good,,,,,,
twenty years later i havent had a word back from him but im still hopeful,True,False,bad,,,,,,
me talk about hamlet to be or not to be that is the question but it is not my question my question is why was i taught as a young woman that this was the quintessential example of human dilemma and human experience it is a marvelous story but actually it is about a young man fearful that he wont be able to make it as a powerful figure in a male world unless he takes revenge for his father s murder he talks a great deal to us about suicide being an option but the reality is that the person who actually commits suicide ophelia after she is been humiliated and abused by him never gets a chance to talk to the audience about her feelings and then when he is finished with ophelia he turns on his mum because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle and enjoy sex,True,True,good,,,,,,
it is a great story but it is a story about male conflict male dilemma male struggle but i was told this was the story of human beings despite the fact that it only had two women in it and unless i reeducate myself i am always going to think that women s stories matter less than men s a woman could have written hamlet but she would have written it differently and it wouldnt have had global recognition as the writer margaret atwood says when a man writes about doing the dishes it is realism when a woman writes about doing it it is an unfortunate genetic disposition,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now leaving aside the disgusting slur on gay women the fact is he wanted to humiliate me he thought it was silly that i wanted to be a director and i told my friend marin alsop the conductor and she said oh yes well my music teacher said exactly the same he said dont conduct but all these years later weve made our mark you think well itll be different now im afraid it is not different now the current head of the paris said recently it takes great physical strength to conduct a symphony and women are too weak,True,True,good,,,,,,
that stories by men are deemed to be of universal importance and stories by women are thought to be merely about women my grandmother left school when she was she had children my mother left school when she was she was a secretary i graduated from university to become a theater director and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people ill never meet fought for women to have rights get the vote get education have progress,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i traveled there last year and part of the joy i had in going there was going to these caves the laas caves now these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world these paintings are thought to be round about to years old art what humanity has done ever since it evolved it is how we speak about ourselves how we understand our identity how we look at our surroundings who we find out about each other because of the meaning of our lives that is what art is for so look at this little picture i think it is a little girl,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i took my two children when they were little caroline was eight and robby was five to see e t and it is a fantastic story of this little alien who ends up in an american family with a mum two brothers and a sister but he wants to go home not only that but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him and theyre looking for him so the children have a plot they decide theyre going to take him back to his spaceship as soon as they can and they plop him in a bicycle basket and off they ride but unfortunately the have found out and theyre catching up and theyve got sirens and theyve got their guns theyve got the loud it is terribly frightening and theyre closing up on the children and the children are never going to make it,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i thought it was interesting because if you read reviews of what he intended with e t he says very specifically i wanted the world to understand that we should love and embrace difference but somehow he didnt include the idea of girls difference in this thinking he thought he was writing a story about all humanity caroline thought he was marginalizing half of humanity he thought he was writing a story about human goodness she thought he was writing a heroic adventure and this is common,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this is common men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication but of course how could they be they are writing from male experience through male s eyes we have to have a look at this ourselves we have to be prepared to go back through all our books and our films all our favorite things and say actually this is written by a male artist not an artist we have to see that so many of these stories are written through a male perspective which is fine but then females need to have percent of the rights for the stage the film the novel the place of creativity let me talk about hamlet,False,False,good,,,,,,
silicon valley is obsessed with disruption but these days the biggest didnt come out of silicon valley it came out of steel towns in ohio rural communities in pennsylvania the panhandle in florida and this last us presidential election was the mother of all disruptions once again politics is personal millions of americans became activists overnight pouring into the streets in record numbers in record time,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now these are big images and big ideas but i really love the small stuff along another wall lorenzetti illustrates the effects of good government on the real and everyday lives of ordinary people with a series of delicious little details in the countryside the hills are landscaped and farmed crops are being sown reaped milled plowed all in one picture crops and livestock are being brought to market in the city builders raise a tower people attend a law lecture a ted talk of the century,True,True,good,,,,,,
now what is amazing about these images from years ago is that theyre familiar to us today we see what democracy looks like we experience the effects of good government in our lives just as lorenzetti did in his life but it is the allegory of bad government that has been haunting me since november it is badly damaged but it reads like today s newspapers and ruling over bad government is not the commune but the tyrant he has horns tusks crossed eyes braided hair he obviously spends a lot of time on that hair,True,True,good,,,,,,
now i study even stalk the old masters,False,False,good,,,,,,
now i study even stalk the old masters this is my desk with a postcard exhibition of some famous and obscure paintings mostly from the italian renaissance now art used to provide me with a necessary break from the hurly burly of politics in my daily work at the but not anymore i was at the women s march in san francisco the day after inauguration and the crowd was chanting this is what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like and there i was holding my sign and my umbrella in the rain and i flashed on an old painting that first captivated me many years ago i struggled to remember the different pieces of an actual painting of good and bad government it was almost like the old master was taunting me,False,False,good,,,,,,
and there i was holding my sign and my umbrella in the rain and i flashed on an old painting that first captivated me many years ago i struggled to remember the different pieces of an actual painting of good and bad government it was almost like the old master was taunting me you want to know what democracy looks like go back and look at my frescoes and so i did in ambrogio lorenzetti finished a monumental commission in the governing council chamber of palazzo it is a painting that speaks to us even screams to us today art is a lie that makes us realize truth pablo picasso once said and as we search for the truth about government we should keep work not a lie but an allegory in our collective mind s eye,False,False,good,,,,,,
seven years old some well meaning adult asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up proudly i said an artist no you dont he said you cant make a living being an artist my little seven picasso dreams were crushed but i gathered myself went off in search of a new dream eventually settling on being a scientist perhaps something like the next albert einstein,True,True,good,,,,,,
he is as you can see we can create any world that we want inside the computer we can make a world with monsters with robots that fall in love we can even make pigs fly,True,True,good,,,,,,
we use science to create something wonderful we use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder this guy wall e is a great example of that he finds beauty in the simplest things but when he came in to lighting we knew we had a big problem we got so out on making wall e this convincing robot that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect,True,True,good,,,,,,
his binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has he doesnt have a face or even traditional dialogue for that matter so the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars to sell his acting and emotions we started lighting and we realized the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections he was starting to look glassy eyed,True,True,good,,,,,,
i have always loved math and science later coding and so i decided to study computer programming in college in my junior year my computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films it was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen i watched these films in wonder transfixed fireworks going off in my head thinking that is what i want to do with my life the idea that all the math science and code i had been learning could come together to create these worlds and characters and stories i connected with was pure magic for me,False,False,good,,,,,,
just two years later i started working at the place that made those films pixar animation studios it was here i learned how we actually execute those films to create our movies we create a three dimensional world inside the computer we start with a point that makes a line that makes a face that creates characters or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest and because it is a three dimensional world we can move a camera around inside that world i was fascinated by all of it but then i got my first taste of lighting,False,False,good,,,,,,
while this is an incredible thing this artistic freedom it can create chaos it can create unbelievable worlds unbelievable movement things that are jarring to the audience so to combat this we tether ourselves with science we use science and the world we know as a backbone to ground ourselves in something and recognizable finding nemo is an excellent example of this a major portion of the movie takes place underwater,False,False,good,,,,,,
research and development we took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer then we broke it back down to see which elements make up that underwater look one of the most critical elements was how the light travels through the water so we coded up a light that mimics this physics first the visibility of the water and then what happens with the color objects close to the eye have their full rich colors as light travels deeper into the water we lose the red wavelengths then the green wavelengths leaving us with blue at the far depths,False,False,good,,,,,,
i sat there on the river for two months without seeing one i thought my over i proposed this stupid story to national geographic what in the heck was i thinking so i had two months to sit there and figure out different ways of what i was going to do in my next life after i was a photographer because they were going to fire me because national geographic is a magazine they remind us all the time they publish pictures not excuses,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and ive come up and all i wanted to do was get out of the water after an hour in these conditions it is so extreme that when i go down almost every dive i vomit into my regulator because my body cant deal with the stress of the cold on my head and so im just so happy that the dive is over i get to hand my camera to my assistant and im looking up at him and im going woo woo woo which means take my camera and he thinks im saying take my picture so we had this little communication breakdown,True,True,good,,,,,,
theyve got those black sinister eyes and those spots on their body they look positively prehistoric and a bit scary and tragically in a scientist was taken down and drowned and she was being consumed by a leopard seal and people were like we knew they were vicious we knew they were and so people love to form their opinions and that is when i got a story idea i want to go to antarctica get in the water with as many leopard seals as i possibly can and give them a fair shake find out if they really are these vicious animals or if theyre misunderstood so this is that story oh and they also happen to eat happy feet,True,True,good,,,,,,
theyre also big theyre not these little harbor seals they are long a thousand pounds and theyre also curiously aggressive you get tourists packed into a zodiac floating in these icy waters and a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon the boat starts to sink they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked all the leopard seal was doing it is just biting a balloon it just sees this big balloon in the ocean it doesnt have hands it is going to take a little bite the boat pops and off they go,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so after five days of crossing the drake passage isnt that beautiful after five days of crossing the drake passage we have finally arrived at antarctica im with my swedish assistant and guide his name is from sweden and he has a lot of experience with leopard seals i have never seen one so we come around the cove in our little zodiac boat and there is this monstrous leopard seal and even in his voice he goes that is a bloody big seal ya,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and what it is trying to do is turn that penguin inside out so it can eat the meat off the bones and then it goes off and gets another one and so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin came under the boat the zodiac starting hitting the hull of the boat and were trying to not fall in the water and we sit down and that is when said to me this is a good seal ya it s time for you to get in the water,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i had such dry mouth probably not as bad as now but i had such such dry mouth and my legs were just trembling i couldnt feel my legs i put my flippers on i could barely part my lips i put my in my mouth and i rolled over the side of the zodiac into the water and this was the first thing she did she came racing up to me engulfed my whole camera and her teeth are up here and down here but before i had gotten in the water had given me amazing advice he said if you get scared you close your eyes ya and shell go away,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so she did this threat display for a few minutes and then the most amazing thing happened she totally relaxed she went off she got a penguin she stopped about feet away from me and she sat there with this penguin the flapping and she let us it go the penguin swims toward me takes off she grabs another one she does this over and over and it dawned on me that she is trying to feed me a penguin why else would she release these penguins at me and after she did this four or five times she swam by me with this dejected look on her face you dont want to be too anthropomorphic but i swear that she looked at me like this useless going to starve in my ocean,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so realizing i couldnt catch swimming penguins shed get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me bobbing like this and shed let them go this didnt work i was laughing so hard and so emotional that my mask was flooding because i was crying underwater just because it was so amazing and so that didnt work so then shed get another penguin and try this ballet like sexy display sliding down this iceberg like this,True,True,good,,,,,,
this went on for four days this just didnt happen a couple of times and then so she realized i couldnt catch live ones so she brought me dead penguins,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face like are you for real because she cant believe i cant eat this penguin because in her world youre either breeding or youre eating and im not breeding so,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and she would get frustrated shed blow bubbles in my face she would i think let me know that i was going to starve but yet she didnt stop she would not stop trying to feed me penguins and on the last day with this female where i thought i had pushed her too far i got nervous because she came up to me she rolled over on her back and she did this deep guttural jackhammer sound this and i thought she is about to bite she is about to let me know she is too frustrated with me what had happened was another seal had snuck in behind me and she did that to threat display she chased that big seal away went and got its penguin and brought it to me,True,True,good,,,,,,
the snow and the ice were my sandbox and the inuit were my teachers,False,False,good,,,,,,
all of my time was spent outside with the inuit playing the snow and the ice were my sandbox and the inuit were my teachers and that is where i became truly obsessed with this polar realm and i knew someday that i was going to do something that had to do with trying to share news about it and protect it id like to share with you for just two minutes only some images a cross section of my work to the beautiful music by brandi carlile have you ever i dont know why national geographic has done this theyve never done this before but theyre allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that ive just completed that is not published yet national geographic doesnt do this so im very excited to be able to share this with you and what these images are youll see them at the start of the slide show there is only about four images but it is of a little bear that lives in the great bear rainforest it s pure white but it is not a polar bear,False,False,good,,,,,,
please enjoy,False,False,good,,,,,,
i appreciate it,False,False,good,,,,,,
and what im trying to do with my work is put faces to this,False,False,good,,,,,,
you glaze over with it and what im trying to do with my work is put faces to this and i want people to understand and get the concept that if we lose ice we stand to lose an entire ecosystem projections are that we could lose polar bears they could become extinct in the next to years and there is no better sexier more beautiful charismatic species for me to hang my campaign on polar bears are amazing hunters this was a bear i sat with for a while on the shores there was no ice around but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it,False,False,good,,,,,,
there was no ice around but this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it and this bear swam out to that seal bearded seal grabbed it swam back and ate it and he was so full he was so happy and so fat eating this seal that as i approached him about feet away to get this picture his only defense was to keep eating more seal and as he ate he was so full he probably had about of meat in his belly and as he ate inside one side of his mouth he was out the other side of his mouth so as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive but it is the ice that is disappearing were finding more and more dead bears in the arctic when i worked on polar bears as a biologist years ago we never found dead bears,False,False,good,,,,,,
were finding more and more dead bears in the arctic when i worked on polar bears as a biologist years ago we never found dead bears and in the last four or five years were finding dead bears popping up all over the place were seeing them in the beaufort sea floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out i found a couple in norway last year were seeing them on the ice these bears are already showing signs of the stress of disappearing ice here s a mother and her two year old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere and theyre riding on this big piece of glacier ice which is great for them theyre safe at this point theyre not going to die of hypothermia,False,False,good,,,,,,
here s a mother and her two year old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere and theyre riding on this big piece of glacier ice which is great for them theyre safe at this point theyre not going to die of hypothermia theyre going to get to land but unfortunately percent of the glaciers in the arctic are also receding right now to the point that the ice is ending up on land and not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem these ringed seals these are the of the arctic these little fat dumplings bundles of blubber are the mainstay of the polar bear and theyre not like the harbor seals that you have here these ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle associated and connected to sea ice they give birth inside the ice and they feed on the arctic cod that live under the ice,False,False,good,,,,,,
they give birth inside the ice and they feed on the arctic cod that live under the ice and here s a picture of sick ice this is a piece of multi year ice that is years old and what scientists didnt predict is that as this ice melts these big pockets of black water are forming and theyre grabbing the sun s energy and accelerating the melting process and here we are diving in the beaufort sea the were on our safety lines the ice is moving all over the place i wish i could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive but what is important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice that big chunk of ice up in the corner,False,False,good,,,,,,
i wish i could spend half an hour telling you about how we almost died on this dive but what is important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi year ice that big chunk of ice up in the corner in that one single piece of ice you have species of microorganisms and in the spring when the sun returns to the ice it forms the phytoplankton grows under that ice and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed and then you get the feeding on all that life so really what the ice does is it acts like a garden it acts like the soil in a garden it is an inverted garden losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden here s me in my office,False,False,good,,,,,,
so yeah im a newspaper cartoonist political cartoonist i dont know if youve heard about it newspapers it is a sort of paper based reader,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that makes a good cartoon but what are you going to do with a flat track pad those square things there is nothing i can do as a cartoonist well i know the world is flat now that is true and the internet has reached every corner of the world the poorest the remotest places every village in africa now has a cyber cafe,True,True,good,,,,,,
and what happens next well youve got mail yeah well the internet has empowered us it has empowered you it has empowered me and it has empowered some other guys as well,True,True,good,,,,,,
you know these last two cartoons i did them live during a conference in hanoi and they were not used to that in communist vietnam,True,False,bad,,,,,,
he was taking pictures of me and of my sketches and i thought this is great a vietnamese fan and as he came the second day i thought wow that is really a cartoon lover and on the third day i finally understood the guy was actually on duty so by now there must be a hundred pictures of me smiling with my sketches in the files of the vietnamese police,True,True,good,,,,,,
no but it is true the internet has changed the world it has rocked the music industry it has changed the way we consume music for those of you old enough to remember we used to have to go to the store to steal it,True,True,good,,,,,,
so be careful with that account your momma told you be careful and technology has set us free this is free but yeah it has liberated us from the office desk this is your life enjoy it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
people died in the violence this was so sickening people died because of cartoons i mean i had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides actually they were used first by a danish newspaper which wanted to make a point on islam,False,False,good,,,,,,
this was so sickening people died because of cartoons i mean i had the feeling at the time that cartoons had been used by both sides actually they were used first by a danish newspaper which wanted to make a point on islam a danish cartoonist told me he was one of the who received the assignment to draw the prophet of them refused did you know that he told me nobody has to tell me what i should draw this is not how it works and then of course they were used by extremists and politicians on the other side they wanted to stir up controversy you know the story,False,False,good,,,,,,
you had a rebellion in the north the government in the south the capital and in the middle the french army this looks like a giant hamburger you dont want to be the ham in the middle i was there to report on that story in cartoons,False,False,good,,,,,,
so back in i was given a chance to lead a workshop with local cartoonists there and i thought yes in a context like this cartoons can really be used as weapons against the other side i mean the press in ivory coast was bitterly divided it was compared to the media in rwanda before the genocide so imagine and what can a cartoonist do sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists to draw what they wanted to see and the guy has to feed his family right so the idea was pretty simple we brought together cartoonists from all sides in ivory coast,False,False,good,,,,,,
and humor is a good way i think to address serious issues and im very proud of what they did i mean they didnt agree with each other that was not the point and i didnt ask them to do nice cartoons the first day they were even shouting at each other but they came up with a book looking back at years of political crisis in ivory coast so the idea was there and ive been doing projects like this in in lebanon this year in kenya back in january in lebanon it was not a book,False,False,good,,,,,,

but i dont really believe in architectural problems i only believe in opportunities which is why ill show you a threat and an architectural response the threat is my response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand stretching across the desert now sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions it is simple and complex it is peaceful and violent it is always the same never the same endlessly fascinating one billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second,False,False,good,,,,,,

the thing is i think we should give ourselves a break if you think about going into a restaurant when you look at the menu are you expected to order every single thing on the menu no you select if you go into a department store to buy a shirt are you going to try on every single shirt and want every single shirt of course not you can be selective it is expected how come then it is not so expected to be selective when we go to an art gallery why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting well im trying to take a different approach and there is two things i do when i go into a gallery first of all i go quite fast and i look at everything and i pinpoint the ones that make me slow down for some reason or other i dont even know why they make me slow down but something pulls me like a magnet and then i ignore all the others and i just go to that painting so it is the first thing i do is i do my own,False,False,good,,,,,,
what made me do it at school i will admit this academically i couldnt express myself so i was more or less classed as nothing my world was seen as less so i decided i didnt really want to be a part of that world i thought i need to retreat into something else so when my mother used to take me to school she thought i was at school and i used to do a u turn when her back was turned and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden now the one time i was in the shed and my mother suspected something thinking i was at school my mother was like the woman in tom and jerry so youd just see her feet,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so im sitting there thinking and as i looked down on the ground i noticed there was some ants running around and i went into this little fantasy world and i thought these ants are they looking for the queen ant or do they need somewhere to live so i thought perhaps if i made these ants some apartments theyll move in,True,False,bad,,,,,,

when i discovered that i had this gift i wanted to experiment with this world that we cant see so i realized that there was more to life than just everything that we see around us that is huge so i started to educate myself on this molecular level and as i got older i continued i showed my mother my mother told me to take it smaller now i shall show you something here and ill explain as you can see that is a,True,True,good,,,,,,
so to cut a long story short i went home went underneath the microscope and i crushed up a piece of glass crushed it up and underneath the microscope there were of glass some of them were quite jagged so i was crushing up these pieces of glass which as you can see that is the actual frame of the house and the actual roof is made up of a fiber which i found in my sister s old teddy bear,True,True,good,,,,,,
and i looked at it beneath the microscope and some of it was flat so i decided to slice these up with the tool that i make by i sharpen the end of a needle into a blade and then i actually slow down my whole nervous system and then i work between my heartbeat i have one half seconds to actually move and at the same time i have to watch i dont inhale my own work at the same time,True,True,good,,,,,,
so after ive done the same thing then i have to paint it and after ive actually sculpted them i have to paint them i experimented with a i found a dead fly and i plucked the hair off the head decided to make a paintbrush,True,True,good,,,,,,
and we use the word nothing nothing doesnt exist because there is always something,False,False,good,,,,,,
what made me do this work i shall go into my story this all started when i was age five what made me do it at school i will admit this academically i couldnt express myself so i was more or less classed as nothing,False,False,good,,,,,,
at that age obviously i couldnt express it that way but i told her i didnt feel right and then she just said youre going back to school tomorrow,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what i did like i said come back to the glass i found these little bits of glass and i had to make them square so im thinking how can i do this so what i did i got an broke the edge of an off,False,False,good,,,,,,

and sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air and you know all different things happen but i had to make a little barrier going around it out of cellophane to stop it moving then static electricity set in and it went and im trying to remove it and the static is interfering with everything,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they go meow ow even though they get on our nerves i would never kill an insect because all creatures great and small there is a hymn that says that so what i decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face and i looked at it underneath the microscope,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i went and then she went ok he is not mad yeah to actually do this thing the actual chariot is made of gold i had a gold ring and i cut off a little flake of gold and i bent it and made it into the chariot and the horse is made from nylon,False,False,good,,,,,,
that ship there that is made from gold and i normally rig it with the web of a money spider but i had to rig it with strands of glue because the web of the spider it was sending me insane because i couldnt get the web to move off and that is gold and it is constructed i built it,False,False,good,,,,,,
so for example one person asked what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at percent of the speed of light so i did some calculations now normally when an object flies through the air the air will flow around the object but in this case the ball would be going so fast that the air molecules wouldnt have time to move out of the way the ball would smash right into and through them and the collisions with these air molecules would knock away the nitrogen carbon and hydrogen from the ball fragmenting it off into tiny particles and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion in the air around it this would result in a flood of x rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles plasma inside centered on the mound and that would move away from the mound slightly faster than the ball now at this point about nanoseconds in the home plate is far enough away that light hasnt had time to reach it which means the batter still sees the pitcher about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but one week a couple months ago i got a question that was actually about if all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards how big would data warehouse be now pretty secretive about their operations so no one really knows how much data has and in fact no one really knows how many data centers has except people at itself and ive tried ive met them a few times tried asking them and they arent revealing anything so i decided to try to figure this out myself there are a few things that i looked at here i started with money,False,False,good,,,,,,
there are a few things that i looked at here i started with money has to reveal how much they spend in general and that lets you put some caps on how many data centers could they be building because a big data center costs a certain amount of money and you can also then put a cap on how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up which turns out it is pretty sizable i read a calculation at one point i think has a drive failure about every minute or two and they just throw out the hard drive and swap in a new one so they go through a huge number of them and so by looking at money you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have you can also look at power you can look at how much electricity they need because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers and is more efficient than most but they still have some basic requirements and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers that they have,False,False,good,,,,,,
not a metaphorical one the way we use it today but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent celtic magic and over the years around the turn of the century it started to take on this other kind of deception this definition for any artificial interest in or association with an object through which it appears magnified or glorified but still glamour is an illusion glamour is a magic spell and there is something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history when the witches cast a magic spell on you it was not in your self interest it was to get you to act against your interest well of course in the century glamour came to have this different meaning associated with hollywood and this is hedy lamarr hedy lamarr said anyone can look glamorous all you have to do is sit there and look stupid,True,True,good,,,,,,
now this was kindly lent to me by jeff from last year this is underneath jeff s desk this is what the real world of computers lamps electrical appliances of all kinds looks like but if you look in a catalog particularly a catalog of modern beautiful objects for your home it looks like this there are no cords look next time you get these catalogs in your mail you can usually figure out where they hid the cord but there is always this illusion that if you buy this lamp you will live in a world without cords,True,False,bad,,,,,,

those tribal societies which constituted all human societies for most of human history are far more diverse than are our modern recent big societies all big societies that have governments and where most people are strangers to each other are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society they constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn,False,False,good,,,,,,
but they had an amazing freedom which was they didnt have to make any money from it the internet has no business plan never did no no firm responsible singly for building it instead it is folks getting together to do something for fun rather than because they were told to or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it that ethos led to a network architecture a structure that was unlike other digital networks then or since so unusual in fact that it was said that it is not clear the internet could work as late as was known to say you couldnt possibly build a corporate network using internet protocol and even some internet engineers today say the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out,True,True,good,,,,,,
that is why the mascot of internet engineering if it had one is said to be the because the fur ratio of the is far too large for it to be able to fly and yet mysteriously somehow the bee flies im pleased to say that thanks to massive government funding about three years ago we finally figured out how bees fly,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so what is this bizarre architecture configuration that makes the network sing and be so unusual well to move data around from one place to another again it is not like a package courier it s more like a mosh pit,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we have a hijacking of this is not a drill it is not just the of engineers i promise something is up in pakistan and they came together to help find the problem and fix it so it is kind of like if your house catches on fire the bad news is there is no fire brigade the good news is random people from nowhere put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise i was trying to think of the right model to describe this form of random acts of kindness by geeky strangers,True,True,good,,,,,,
number two if a man named came up to you in and said ive got a great idea we start with seven articles that anybody can edit anything at any time and well get a great encyclopedia eh right dumbest idea ever,True,True,good,,,,,,
jimbo s idea was for it was going to be totally traditional he would pay people money because he was feeling like a good guy and the money would go to the people and they would write the articles the was introduced so others could make suggestions on edits as almost an afterthought a back room and then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project and today is so ubiquitous that you can now find it on chinese restaurant menus,True,False,bad,,,,,,
number one tendentious editing by user apologies if youre here today im not taking sides attacking me for reverting here is my favorite a long story,True,True,good,,,,,,
that is what keeps afloat at all times is approximately minutes away from utter destruction right there are crawling it trying to turn every article into an ad for a rolex watch,True,True,good,,,,,,
we see it on all over the place i mean this is a business week cover wow are going to change your business i know they look silly and sure they look silly they start off on all sorts of goofy projects this is my favorite,True,True,good,,,,,,
in the real world we see filtering of this sort taking place in pakistan and we now have means that we can build like this system so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it and it is no longer just a i dont know i couldnt get there i guess ill move on but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blocked and censored where online in fact talk about technology imitating life imitating tech or maybe it is the other way around an researcher here took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination it said can you help me get there released it on the streets of manhattan,True,True,good,,,,,,
i dont know as a simple example we could run a test here how many people have ever i know how many people have within the past years right so what has changed it is not better public transportation so that is one reason to think that we might be going in the wrong direction but i want to give you three examples to try to say that the trend line is in fact in the other direction and it is the internet helping it along so example number one the internet itself these are three of the founders of the internet,False,False,good,,,,,,
so example number one the internet itself these are three of the founders of the internet they were actually high school classmates together at the same high school in suburban los angles in the you might have had a french club or a debate club they had a let us build a global network club and it worked out very well they are pictured here for their anniversary newsweek retrospective on the internet and as you can tell they are basically goof balls they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network the limitation was that they didnt have any money,False,False,good,,,,,,
no one pays you to do this it is just part of your neighborly duty and in a way that is exactly how packets move around the internet sometimes in as many as or hops with the intervening entities that are passing the data around having no particular contractual or legal obligation to the original sender or to the receiver now of course in a mosh pit it is hard to specify a destination you need a lot of trust but it is not like im trying to get to pensacola please,False,False,good,,,,,,
now of course in a mosh pit it is hard to specify a destination you need a lot of trust but it is not like im trying to get to pensacola please so the internet needs addressing and directions it turns out there is no one overall map of the internet instead again it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater but we can only see amidst the fog the people immediately around us so what do we do to figure out who is where we turn to the person on the right and we tell that person what we see on our left and vice versa and they can lather rinse repeat and before you know it you have a general sense of where everything is,False,False,good,,,,,,
is how internet addressing and actually work this is a system that relies on kindness and trust which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable in rare but striking instances a single lie told by just one entity in this honeycomb can lead to real trouble so for example last year the government of pakistan asked its internet service providers there to prevent citizens of pakistan from seeing there was a video there that the government did not like and they wanted to make sure it was blocked this is a common occurrence governments everywhere are often trying to block and filter and censor content on the internet,False,False,good,,,,,,
well this one in pakistan chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers in a rather unusual way it advertised the way that you might be asked if you were part of the internet to declare what you see near you it advertised that near it in fact it had suddenly awakened to find that it was that is right it said i am which meant that packets of data from subscribers going to stopped at the since they thought they were already there and the threw them away unopened because the point was to block it but it didnt stop there you see that announcement went one click out which got reverberated one click out and it turns out that as you look at the postmortem of this event you have at one moment perfectly working,False,False,good,,,,,,
theyre realizing that they have to take responsibility for what they do and has embraced this some of you may remember star wars kid the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever acting as if it were a light saber the film without his permission or even knowledge at first found its way onto the internet hugely viral video,False,False,good,,,,,,
the film without his permission or even knowledge at first found its way onto the internet hugely viral video extremely popular totally to him now it being encyclopedic and all had to do an article about star wars kid every article on has a corresponding discussion page and on the discussion page they had extensive argument among the as to whether to have his real name featured in the article you could see arguments on both sides here is just a snapshot of some of them they eventually decided not unanimously by any means not to include his real name despite the fact that nearly all media reports did,False,False,good,,,,,,
here is just a snapshot of some of them they eventually decided not unanimously by any means not to include his real name despite the fact that nearly all media reports did they just didnt think it was the right thing to do it was an act of kindness and to this day the page for star wars kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page if you do it will be removed immediately removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision but respect the outcome and work to make it stay because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion as a lawyer ive got to say these guys are inventing the law and stare and stuff like that as they go along now this isnt just limited to we see it on all over the place,False,False,good,,,,,,
but then you hit this one image removed at request of owner,False,False,good,,,,,,
weve got a climate crisis so we went around the table to talk about what we should do the conversation came to my old daughter mary she said i agree with everything that is been said im scared and im angry and then she turned to me and said dad your generation created this problem youd better fix it wow all the conversation stopped all the eyes turned to me,True,False,bad,,,,,,

shortly after i saw that we had some friends over for dinner with the family the conversation turned to global warming and everybody agreed there is a real problem weve got a climate crisis,False,False,good,,,,,,

we went to brazil we went to china and to india to bentonville arkansas to washington d c and to sacramento and so what id like to do now is to tell you about what weve learned in those journeys because the more we learned the more concerned we grew you know my partners at kleiner and i were compulsive and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity like flu or personalized medicine we just get together the smartest people we know for this climate crisis we assembled a network really of superstars from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs and business leaders fifty or so of them,False,False,good,,,,,,
a couple of years ago when i was attending the ted conference in long beach i met harriet wed actually met online before not the way youre thinking we were introduced because we both knew linda avey one of the founders of the first online personal companies and because we shared our genetic information with linda she could see that harriet and i shared a very rare type of which meant we were related we actually share the same genealogy with the iceman so harriet and me and being the current day of course we started our own group youre all welcome to join when i met harriet in person the next year at the ted conference shed gone online and ordered our own happy t shirts,True,True,good,,,,,,

the way i met harriet is an example of how leveraging cross disciplinary exponentially growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness from low cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful to the connection of the internet and social networking what id like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies we often think linearly but if you think about it if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day two four eight sixteen in days youd have,False,False,good,,,,,,
ive been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called university based in silicon valley we bring together each summer about very talented students from around the world and we look at these exponential technologies from medicine biotech artificial intelligence robotics space and address how we can cross train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals we also have seven day executive programs and coming up next month is a program to help cross train and leverage technologies into medicine now i mentioned the phone these mobile phones have over different mobile apps available there is one out of the where you can pee on a little chip connect it to your and check for an i dont know if id try that but it is available,False,False,good,,,,,,
but here comes nature that provides us with a good spider this is a predatory mite just as small as a spider mite one two millimeters long not more than that running quickly hunting chasing the spider mites and here you can see this lady in action on your left hand side just sucks the body fluids on the left hand side of the pest mite and after five minutes this is what you see just a typical dead corpse the shriveled sucked out dead corpse of the spider mite and next to it two individuals predatory mites a mother on the left hand side a young nymph on the right hand side by the way a meal for them for hours is about five of the spider mites of the bad mites and or to eggs of the pest mites by the way they are always hungry,True,False,bad,,,,,,

and here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp here we are not talking about a predator here we are talking a parasite not a two legged parasite but an eight legged parasite of course this is a parasitic wasp again two millimeters long slender a very quick and sharp flier and here you can see this parasite in action like in an acrobatic maneuver she stands in front of the victim at the right hand side bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid by the way the aphid tries to escape she kicks and bites and different liquids but nothing will happen in fact only the egg of the will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid and after a few days depending upon temperature the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside,True,True,good,,,,,,

im a bug lover myself not from childhood by the way but rather late when i majoring in zoology at tel aviv university i kind of fell in love with bugs and then within zoology i took the course or the discipline of entomology the science of insects and then i thought to myself how can i be practical or help in the science of entomology and then i moved to the world of plant protection plant protection from insects from bad bugs and then within plant protection i came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests,False,False,good,,,,,,
well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples what is a pest what damage does it actually inflict on the plant and what is the natural enemy the biological control agent or the good bug that were talking about in general im going to talk about insects and spiders or mites let us call them insects those six legged organisms and spiders or mites the eight legged organisms let us have a look at that here is a devastating pest a spider mite because it does a lot of webbing like a spider you see the mother in between and two daughters probably on the left and right and a single egg on the right hand side,False,False,good,,,,,,
have something in common their interests in business lie on or near the earth s surface the odd one out is an astronomer and i am one of that strange breed,True,True,good,,,,,,
we know our universes are united though links between left and right the everyday world is determined by atoms how they stick together to make molecules stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together and as weve learned in the last few years galaxies are held together by the gravitational pull of so called dark matter particles in huge swarms far smaller even than atomic nuclei but wed like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top the micro world of the quantum is understood on the right hand side gravity holds sway einstein explained that but the unfinished business for century science is to link together cosmos and micro world with a unified theory symbolized as it were at the top of that picture,True,True,good,,,,,,
and in fact we are midway it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us the geometric mean of the mass of a proton and the mass of the sun is kilograms within a factor of two of the mass of each person here well most of you anyway the science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all greater than that of the very small on the left and the very large on the right and it is this science which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world but also transforming our world faster than ever and more than that it is new kinds of change and i now move on to the second part of my talk and the book our final century was mentioned if i was not a self effacing brit i would mention the book myself and i would add that it is available in paperback,True,False,bad,,,,,,

ill talk first as an astronomer and then as a worried member of the human race but let us start off by remembering that darwin showed how were the outcome of four billion years of evolution and what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology is to go back before simple beginning to set our earth in a cosmic context and let me just run through a few slides this was the impact that happened last week on a comet if theyd sent a nuke it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday,False,False,good,,,,,,
this was the impact that happened last week on a comet if theyd sent a nuke it would have been rather more spectacular than what actually happened last monday so that is another project for nasa that is mars from the european mars express and at new year this artist s impression turned into reality when a parachute landed on titan saturn s giant moon it landed on the surface this is pictures taken on the way down that looks like a coastline it is indeed but the ocean is liquid methane the temperature minus degrees centigrade,False,False,good,,,,,,
that looks like a coastline it is indeed but the ocean is liquid methane the temperature minus degrees centigrade if we go beyond our solar system weve learned that the stars arent points of light each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it and we can see places where stars are forming like the eagle nebula we see stars dying in six billion years the sun will look like that and some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion leaving remnants like that on a still bigger scale we see entire galaxies of stars,False,False,good,,,,,,
on a still bigger scale we see entire galaxies of stars we see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled and to the these galaxies are just the atoms as it were of the large scale universe this picture shows a patch of sky so small that it would take about patches like it to cover the full moon in the sky through a small telescope this would look quite blank but you see here hundreds of little faint each is a galaxy fully like ours or andromeda which looks so small and faint because its light has taken billion light years to get to us the stars in those galaxies probably dont have planets around them there s scant chance of life there that is because there is been no time for the nuclear fusion in stars to make silicon and carbon and iron the building blocks of planets and of life,False,False,good,,,,,,
because as soon as you hear the word dutchman which is an archaic word nobody calls dutch people anymore but as soon as you hear dutchman you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike preventing the thing from falling and flooding holland and so on and so the entire issue is by the use of dutchman now if you think im exaggerating at all in this all you have to do is substitute something else like indonesian,True,True,good,,,,,,
now swiss works but you know it is going to cost a lot of money,True,False,bad,,,,,,
sometimes in the middle of a resistant problem i write down things that i know about it but you can see the beginning of an idea there because you can see the word new emerging from the old that is what happens there is a relationship between the old and the new the new emerges from the context of the old and then i did some variations of it but it still wasnt coalescing graphically at all i had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues the w was clearly a w the n was clearly an n even though they were very fragmentary and there wasnt a lot of information in it then i got the words new and old and now i had back to a point where there seemed to be no return,True,True,good,,,,,,
on a work by piero in this case that remarkable painting that is in the the duke of who faces his consort battista once i realized that i could take some liberties with the subject i did the following series of drawings that is the real piero della francesca one of the greatest portraits in human history and these ill just show these without comment it is just a series of variations on the head of the duke of who is a great great figure in the renaissance and probably the basis for machiavelli s the prince he apparently lost an eye in battle which is why he is always shown in profile and this is battista,False,False,good,,,,,,
the phrase is expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art making a sort of aint what you do it is the way that you do notion the shadow of falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word hidden in the word the four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined as a thing itself the worth of the thing the shadow of the thing and the shape of the thing whatever,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the one that i did not submit which i still like i wanted to use the same phrase there were wonderful experiments by bruno on some years ago sort of see how far you could go and still be able to read them and that idea stuck in my head but then i took the pieces that i had taken off and put them at the bottom,False,False,good,,,,,,
bruno suzanne just a curiosity what youre wearing is not random suzanne lee no this is one of the jackets you grew yes it is it s probably part of the project s still in process because this one is actually in front of your eyes,True,True,good,,,,,,
so as a fashion designer ive always tended to think of materials something like this or this or maybe this but then i met a biologist and now i think of materials like this green tea sugar a few microbes and a little time im essentially using a recipe which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria yeasts and other micro organisms which spin cellulose in a fermentation process over time these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface so we start by brewing the tea i brew up to about liters of tea at a time and then while it is still hot add a couple of kilos of sugar,False,False,good,,,,,,
and you know there is not much there wasnt much i could do and they kept on doing what they were doing and about three years later when i left the hospital i started studying at the university and one of the most interesting lessons i learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way and you can try to examine this question maybe learn something about the world so that is what i did i was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients so originally i didnt have much money so i went to a hardware store and i bought a carpenter s vice and i would bring people to the lab and i would put their finger in it and i would crunch it a little bit,True,True,good,,,,,,
first we asked half the people to recall either books they read in high school or to recall the ten commandments and then we tempted them with cheating turns out the people who tried to recall the ten commandments and in our sample nobody could recall all of the ten commandments but those people who tried to recall the ten commandments given the opportunity to cheat did not cheat at all it wasnt that the more religious people the people who remembered more of the commandments cheated less and the less religious people the people who couldnt remember almost any commandments cheated more the moment people thought about trying to recall the ten commandments they stopped cheating in fact even when we gave self declared atheists the task of swearing on the bible and we give them a chance to cheat they dont cheat at all now ten commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said why dont we get people to sign the honor code so we got people to sign i understand that this short survey falls under the mit honor code then they shredded it no cheating whatsoever and this is particularly interesting because mit doesnt have an honor code,True,False,bad,,,,,,
here is what happens it turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt theyre wearing here is the thing we ran this at carnegie mellon and pittsburgh and at pittsburgh there are two big universities carnegie mellon and university of pittsburgh all of the subjects sitting in the experiment were carnegie mellon students when the actor who was getting up was a carnegie mellon student he was actually a carnegie mellon student but he was a part of their group cheating went up but when he actually had a university of pittsburgh sweatshirt cheating went down,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality and my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital i was burned very badly and if you spend a lot of time in hospital youll see a lot of types of and the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me now you must have all taken a band aid off at some point and you must have wondered what is the right approach,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then like all good academic projects i got more funding i moved to sounds electrical shocks i even had a pain suit that i could get people to feel much more pain but at the end of this process what i learned was that the nurses were wrong here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time it turns out that because we dont encode duration in the way that we encode intensity i would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and move toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful,False,False,good,,,,,,
here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time it turns out that because we dont encode duration in the way that we encode intensity i would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower it turns out it would have been better to start with my face which was much more painful and move toward my legs giving me a trend of improvement over time that would have been also less painful and it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain all of these would have been great things to do and my nurses had no idea and from that point on i started thinking are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision or is it a more general case and it turns out it is a more general case there is a lot of mistakes we do and i want to give you one example of one of these and i want to talk to you about cheating and the reason i picked cheating is because it is interesting but also it tells us something i think about the stock market situation were in so my interest in cheating started when enron came on the scene exploded all of a sudden and i started thinking about what is happening here,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this was our first attempt starting with the digital information of the genome of phi it is a small virus that kills bacteria we designed the pieces went through our error correction and had a molecule of about letters the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it in the bacteria and the bacteria started to read this genetic code made the viral particles the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e coli i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model,True,True,good,,,,,,
when we first this genome in the standard of accuracy was one error per base pairs we actually found on it errors had we used that original sequence it never would have been able to be booted up part of the design is designing pieces that are letters long that have to overlap with all the other pieces to build smaller we have to design so they can go together,False,False,good,,,,,,
we are seeking normal human brains there is a lot of criteria by which were selecting these brains we want to make sure that we have normal humans between the ages of to they died a somewhat natural death with no injury to the brain no history of psychiatric disease no drugs on board we do a toxicology and were very careful about the brains that we do take were also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue we can get consent to take the tissue within hours of time of death because what were trying to measure the which is the readout from our genes is very and so we have to move very quickly one side note on the collection of brains because of the way that we collect and because we require consent we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life and men are much more likely to have their significant other spouse give consent than the other way around,True,True,good,,,,,,
we chart it weve described it weve drawn it weve mapped it now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology think maps think the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation so let us take a look at the brain most people when they first look at a fresh human brain they say it doesnt look what youre typically looking at when someone shows you a brain typically what youre looking at is a fixed brain,False,False,good,,,,,,
in south africa in cape town the local community of philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum it was a school and i wrote on it a quote from nelson mandela saying in arabic which means it seems impossible until it is done then this guy came to me and said man why you dont write in english and i replied to him i would consider your concern legit if you asked me why i didnt write in zulu in paris once there was this event and someone gave his wall to be painted and when he saw i was painting in arabic he got so mad actually hysterical and he asked for the wall to be erased i was mad and disappointed but a week later the organizer of the event asked me to come back and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy s house so this guy like was forced to see it every day,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i painted the minaret of jara mosque in my hometown of in the south of tunisia i never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city at the beginning i was just looking for a wall in my hometown and it happened that the minaret was built in and for years those meters of concrete stayed grey when i met the imam for the first time and i told him what i wanted to do he was like thank god you finally came and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it the most amazing thing about this imam is that he didnt ask me anything neither a sketch or what i was going to write in every work that i create i write messages with my style of a mix of calligraphy and graffiti,False,False,good,,,,,,
if it is see it for a long enough time i actually do something about it and the very last one is a billboard this is our roof in new york the roof of the studio this is newsprint plus that lie on the newsprint we let that lie around in the sun as you all know newsprint yellows significantly in the sun after a week we took the and the leaves off shipped the to lisbon to a very sunny spot so on day one the billboard said complaining is silly either act or forget three days later it faded and a week later no more complaining anywhere,True,True,good,,,,,,
were doing changing media this is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by you cant help but actually ripping that spider web apart,False,False,good,,,,,,
im a a filmmaker and a butcher and ill explain how these identities come together it started four years ago when a friend and i opened our first ramadan fast at one of the busiest mosques in new york city crowds of men with beards and were swarming the streets it was an agent s wet dream,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and as these birds walk played at film festivals and theaters internationally i finally had my feet planted at home in new york and with all the extra time and still no real money my wife tasked me to cook more for us and whenever id go to the local butcher to purchase some meat something felt off for those that dont know is a term used for meat that is raised and slaughtered humanely following very strict islamic guidelines unfortunately the majority of meat in america doesnt rise to the standard that my faith calls for the more i learned about these unethical practices the more violated i felt particularly because businesses from my own community were the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy so with emotions running high and absolutely no experience in butchery some friends and i opened a meat store in the heart of the east village fashion district,True,True,good,,,,,,
for years id seen photos of this space being documented as a lifeless and cold monolith much like the stereotypical image painted of the american muslim experience frustrated by this myopic view my friend and i had this crazy idea let us break our fast at a different mosque in a different state each night of ramadan and share those stories on a we called it mosques in days and we drove to all the states and shared stories from over vastly different muslim communities ranging from the cambodian refugees in the l a projects to the black living in the woods of south carolina what emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of america the media coverage forced local journalists to revisit their muslim communities but what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world being inspired to take their own journey there were even these two athletes who took a sabbatical from the league to do so,False,False,good,,,,,,
they are a visceral response to the businesses and curators who work hard to oversimplify my beliefs and my community and the only way to beat their machine is to play by different rules we must fight with an inventive approach with the trust with the access with the love that only we can bring we must reclaim our beliefs in every moving image in every cut of meat because if we whitewash our stories for the sake of mass appeal not only will we fail but we will be trumped by those with more money and more resources to tell our stories but the call for creative courage is not for novelty or relevance it is simply because our communities are so damn unique and so damn beautiful they demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected,False,False,good,,,,,,

so one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost but really how long they interacted with the robot because the challenge is not losing weight it is actually keeping it off and the longer you could interact with one of these interventions well that is indicative potentially of longer term success so the first thing i want to look at is how long how long did people interact with these systems it turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer when it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more,True,False,bad,,,,,,
people would name the robots they would dress the robots,True,True,good,,,,,,
ever since i was a little girl seeing star wars for the first time ive been fascinated by this idea of personal robots and as a little girl i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful trusted sidekick something that would delight us enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two i knew robots like that didnt really exist but i knew i wanted to build them so years pass i am now a graduate student at mit studying artificial intelligence the year is and nasa has just landed the first robot on mars but robots are still not in our home ironically and i remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case,False,False,good,,,,,,
but robots are still not in our home ironically and i remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case but one really struck me robotics had really been about interacting with things not with people certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives for me that was the white space that is what robots could not do yet and so that year i started to build this robot kismet the world s first social robot three years later a lot of programming working with other graduate students in the lab kismet was ready to start interacting with people scientist i want to show you something this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me,False,False,good,,,,,,
yeah look it is got a little blue light in it too i almost lost it this week so kismet interacted with people like kind of a non verbal child or pre verbal child which i assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind it didnt speak language but it didnt matter this little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us and with that the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots so over the past several years ive been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students and one of my favorite robots is leonardo,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then this is the first part of this is spheres since the sun is times the diameter of the earth and so this is the size of the sun and then each of these little spheres is the size of the earth in proportion to the sun it is made up of concentric shells each one has spheres this is in the courtyard of a twelfth century alchemist i was thinking that the sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist,True,True,good,,,,,,
this is something i did of a tactile communication system it was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture and then putting it into a communication system this is an idea of moving a sculpture a ball that would be directed around the room by a computer this is a clock i designed it has buckminster fuller s map edited here it turns once per day in with the earth and then this is like projects that are harder to build,True,True,good,,,,,,
the aluminum is because it is very light the bronze is nice hard durable material that could roll on the ground,False,False,good,,,,,,
the aluminum is because it is very light the bronze is nice hard durable material that could roll on the ground inside of the bronze ball there is a lead weight that is free swinging on an axle that is on two bearings that pass in between across it like this that counterbalance this weight so it allows it to roll and the sphere has that balance property that it always sort of stays still and looks the same from every direction but if you put something on top of it it it and so it would tip over but in this case because the interior is free swinging in relation to the sphere it can stand up on one point and then there was a second level to this object which is that it i wanted it to convey some proportions that i was interested in which is the diameter of the moon and the diameter of the earth in proportion to each other,False,False,good,,,,,,
by adding an element of embellishment reporters call this making shit up,True,True,good,,,,,,
but these studies also reveal that communication relies on a common ground and we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us because we let a few very strong media channels take control of the mic and manipulate and control the way we all think and im not sure how to fix it because im only a scientist but maybe one way to do it is to go back to the more natural way of communication which is a dialogue in which it is not only me speaking to you now but a more natural way of talking in which i am speaking and i am listening and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas because after all the people we are coupled to define who we are and our desire to be coupled to another brain is something very basic that starts at a very early age so let me finish with an example from my own private life that i think is a good example of how coupling to other people is really going to define who we are this my son jonathan at a very early age see how he developed a vocal game together with my wife only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being,True,True,good,,,,,,
imagine that you invented a device that can record my memories my dreams my ideas and transmit them to your brain that would be a game changing technology right but in fact we already possess this device and it is called human communication system and effective storytelling to understand how this device works we have to look into our brains and we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner now we have to ask how these patterns in my brain that are associated with my memories and ideas are transmitted into your brains,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok so now let us look into your brain and see what is happening when you listen to these kinds of stories and let us start simple let us start with one listener and one brain area the auditory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear and as you can see in this particular brain area the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding,False,False,good,,,,,,
i want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you or if you were delivering about the person you were delivering and you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud it was the first two were it is a girl boy,True,True,good,,,,,,
and i was confused does this make so gay does this make so straight i was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity and my patient said to me look look look if you just think of the following youll get it right sexual orientation is who you go to bed with gender identity is who you go to bed as,True,True,good,,,,,,
and some of them have been rearranged a little bit but it is all her and she is become a remarkable spokeswoman and she was offered contracts as a model at which point she teased me when she said you know i might have had a better chance as a model if youd made me six feet one,True,True,good,,,,,,
well it shows you that i also deal with issues where there is not certainty of whether it is a girl or a boy so the mixed answer was very appropriate of course now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound unless the prospective parents choose to be surprised like we all were but i want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement on the third word because the third word is a description of your sex and by that i mean made by a description of your genitals now as a pediatric endocrinologist i used to be very very involved and still somewhat am in cases in which there are mismatches in the or between the and the and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex but there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth that would define you,False,False,good,,,,,,
now this is relatively rare so i had relatively little personal experience with this and my experience was more typical only because i had an adolescent practice and i saw someone age genetically female went through harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story a registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name and came to me after graduating saying help me i know you know a lot of endocrinology and indeed ive treated a lot of people who were born without this wasnt rocket science,False,False,good,,,,,,
i subsequently learned from the many adults i took care of about adults i learned from them that if i didnt peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room i would never be able to guess better than chance whether they were gay straight bi or in their affirmed gender in other words one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other and the data show it now as i took care of the adults i found it extremely painful these people many of them had to give up so much of their lives sometimes their parents would reject them siblings their own children and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children,False,False,good,,,,,,
so why was he moved like other prisoners mcgowan repeatedly asked for an answer a hearing or some opportunity for an appeal this example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed wants a transfer told him no at one point the prison warden himself recommended mcgowan s transfer out of the citing his good behavior but the warden was overruled by the bureau of prison s counterterrorism unit working with the joint terrorism task force of the later i found out that mcgowan was really sent to a not because of what he did but what he has said a memo from the counterterrorism unit cited mcgowan s anti government beliefs while imprisoned he continued writing about environmental issues saying that activists must reflect on their mistakes and listen to each other now in fairness if youve spent any time at all in washington you know this is really a radical concept for the government,True,True,good,,,,,,
father daniel berrigan once said that writing about prisoners is a little like writing about the dead i think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts theyre unseen and unheard it is easy to simply ignore them and it is even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden as a journalist i think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching are precisely the stories that we need to tell that s why i began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the united states for so called second tier terrorists,False,False,good,,,,,,
you hook these up in this case to the virtual muscles of that two legged creature here and hope that it does something interesting at the beginning theyre all going to be very boring most of them wont move at all but some of them might make a tiny step those are then selected by the algorithm reproduced with mutation and to introduce sex as well and you repeat that process over and over again until you have something that walks in this case in a straight line like this so that was the idea behind this when we started this i set up the simulation one evening it took about three to four hours to run the simulation i got up the next morning went to the computer and looked at the results and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line like ive just demonstrated and this is what i got instead,True,True,good,,,,,,
so it was back to the drawing board for us we did get it to work eventually after tweaking a bit here and there and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run so what youll see in a moment is a very simple that is learning how to walk using artificial evolution at the beginning it cant walk at all but it will get better and better over time so this is the one that cant walk at all,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now after five generations of applying evolutionary process the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better,True,True,good,,,,,,
generation and itll take a few steps more still not quite there but now after generation it actually walks in a straight line without falling over that was the real breakthrough for us it was academically quite a challenging project and once we had reached that stage we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it now at this stage it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds what you see here is the character standing there and there is an obstacle that we put in its way and what you see is it is going to fall over the obstacle now the interesting bit is if i move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right which is what im doing now here it will fall over it in a completely different way and again if you move the obstacle a tiny bit itll again fall differently,True,False,bad,,,,,,
again a push now this time from the front and you see it falls differently and now from the left and it falls differently that was really exciting for us to see that that was the first time weve seen that this is the first time the public sees this as well because we have been in stealth mode i havent shown this to anybody yet now just a fun thing what happens if you put that character this is now a wooden version of it but it is got the same ai in it but if you put that character on a slippery surface like ice we just did that for a laugh just to see what happens,True,True,good,,,,,,
and that is a really fascinating thing about this approach now when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology we got a very good response and what they said was the first thing they need immediately is virtual because stunts are obviously very dangerous theyre very expensive and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do obviously because you cant really allow the to be seriously hurt so they wanted to have a digital version of a and that is what weve been working on for the past few months and that is our first product that were going to release in a couple of weeks so here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked that is what people want that s what were giving them,True,True,good,,,,,,
you can see it is always reacting this is not a dead body this is a body who basically in this particular case feels the force and tries to protect its head only i think it is quite a big blow again you feel kind of sorry for that thing and weve seen it so many times now that we dont really care any more,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this thing doesnt have a head im not quite sure why so this was not something we actually put in there he just started to create that dance himself he is actually a better dancer than i am i have to say and what you see after a while i think he even goes into a climax right at the end and i think there you go,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this is a clip from a game called grand theft auto we already saw that briefly yesterday,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is a clip from a game called grand theft auto we already saw that briefly yesterday and what you can see is it is actually a very good game it is one of the most successful games of all time but what youll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive they pretty much look the same ive made him run into a wall here over and over again and you can see he looks always the same the reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters,False,False,good,,,,,,
it also means that games arent really going to be as surprising as they could be because you only get out of it at least in terms of the character what you actually put into it there s no real emergence there,False,False,good,,,,,,
and thirdly as i said most of the animations are very repetitive because of that now the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body and maybe if i could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is because i mean it is very very trivial if i push chris a bit like this for example hell react to it if i push him from a different angle hell react to it differently and that is because he has a physical body and because he has the motor skills to control that body it is a very trivial thing it s not something you get in computer games at the moment at all,False,False,good,,,,,,
if i push him from a different angle hell react to it differently and that is because he has a physical body and because he has the motor skills to control that body it is a very trivial thing it is not something you get in computer games at the moment at all thank you very much chris anderson that is it that is it yes so that is what were trying to simulate not chris specifically i should say but humans in general now we started working on this a while ago at oxford university and we tried to start very simply what we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk that stick figure is physically stimulated,False,False,good,,,,,,
what we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk that stick figure is physically stimulated you can see it here on the screen so it is subject to gravity has joints etc if you just run the simulation it will just collapse like this the tricky bit is now to put an ai controller in it that actually makes it work and for that we use the neural network which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans it is called the central pattern generator so we simulated that as well and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk,False,False,good,,,,,,
now this might look kind of trivial but it is actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds now at this stage we decided to start a company and move this further because obviously this was just a very simple,False,False,good,,,,,,
i should add that it is very simple to add things like hair clothes etc but what weve done here is use a very simple visualization so you can concentrate on the movement now what im going to do right now in a moment is just push this character a tiny bit and well see what happens nothing really interesting basically it falls over but it falls over like a rag doll basically the reason for that is that there is no intelligence in it it becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it so this character now has motor skills in the upper body nothing in the legs yet in this particular one but what it will do im going to push it again,False,False,good,,,,,,
here is one that came in over the united states in october of it came in on a friday night why is that important because back then video cameras were just starting to become popular and parents would bring them to their kids football games to film their kids playing football and since this came in on a friday they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over west virginia maryland pennsylvania and new jersey until it did that to a car in new york,True,True,good,,,,,,
there is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock and in fact if any of you have ever been to near winslow arizona there is a crater in the desert there that is so that it is actually called meteor crater to give you a sense of scale this is about a mile wide if you look up at the top that is a parking lot and those are recreational vehicles right there so it is about a mile across feet deep the object that formed this was probably about to yards across so roughly the size of auditorium here it came in at speeds that were tremendous slammed into the ground blew up and exploded with the energy of roughly a nuclear bomb a very hefty bomb this was years ago so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope or something like that out in the desert but it probably would not have caused global devastation it turns out that these things dont have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage now in over siberia near the region for those of you who are dan aykroyd fans and saw ghostbusters when he talked about the greatest cross dimensional rift since the siberia blast of where he got the date wrong but that is ok,True,True,good,,,,,,
that is a great first step but what is the second step the second step is if we see one heading toward us we have to stop it what do we do youve probably heard about the asteroid if you havent yet you will if youve heard about the mayan apocalypse youre going to hear about because youre keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway,True,True,good,,,,,,
you might think why dont we use a nuclear weapon well you can try that but the problem is timing shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else youll miss it and there are a lot of other problems with that it is very hard to do but just hitting something that is pretty easy i think even nasa can do that and proved that they can,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the problem is if you hit this asteroid youve changed the orbit you measure the orbit then you find out oh yeah we just pushed it into a keyhole and now it is going to hit us in three years well my opinion is fine it is not hitting us in six months that is good now we have three years to do something else and you can hit it again that is kind of ham fisted you might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever so you dont do that and this is the part it is the part i just love,True,False,bad,,,,,,
after the big macho bam were gonna hit this thing in the face then we bring in the velvet gloves,True,False,bad,,,,,,
a chunk of rock six miles across moving something like times the speed of a rifle bullet slammed into the earth it released its energy all at once and it was an explosion that was mind numbing if you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the cold war lumped them together and blew them up at the same time that would be one one millionth of the energy released at that moment the dinosaurs had a really bad day ok now a six rock is very large,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you look out your window and see longs peak youre probably familiar with it now scoop up longs peak and put it out in space take meeker mt meeker lump that in there and put that in space as well and mt everest,False,False,good,,,,,,
now this is not a wide crater but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here about the size of a football that hit that car and did that damage now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in it broke up through atmospheric pressure it crumbled and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage now you wouldnt want that falling on your foot or your head because it would do that to it that would be bad but it wont wipe out you know all life on earth so that is fine,False,False,good,,,,,,
another rock came into the earth s atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground several miles up above the surface of the earth the heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles this did a huge amount of damage and again this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that were sitting in in meteor crater it was made of metal and metal is much tougher so it made it to the ground the one over was probably made of rock and that is much more so it blew up in the air,False,False,good,,,,,,
what can we do about this this is a potential threat let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur killer for million years theyre very rare the smaller ones happen more often but probably on the order of a millennium every few centuries or every few thousand years but it is still something to be aware of,False,False,good,,,,,,
theyre very rare the smaller ones happen more often but probably on the order of a millennium every few centuries or every few thousand years but it is still something to be aware of well what do we do about them the first thing we have to do is find them this is an image of an asteroid that passed us in it is right here but you can see that it is extremely faint i dont know if you can see that in the back row these are just stars,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is a rock that was about yards across so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over and hit arizona years ago these things are faint theyre hard to see and the sky is really big we have to find these things first well the good news is were looking for them nasa has devoted money to this the national science foundation and other countries are interested in doing this were building telescopes that are looking for the threat,False,False,good,,,,,,
is going to hit us and it is meters across so it would do unbelievable damage the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go around are one in a million roughly very very low odds so i personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all i dont think is a problem in fact is a blessing in disguise because it woke us up to the dangers of these things,False,False,good,,,,,,
in front of this tank there is a man on a bicycle with a breadbasket on his head to any passerby there is no problem with this visual after acts of violence another artist came painted blood protesters being run over by the tank demonstrators and a message that read starting tomorrow i wear the new face the face of every martyr i exist authority comes paints the wall white leaves the tank and adds a message army and people one hand egypt for egyptians another artist comes paints the head of the military as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood in front of the tank authority comes paints the wall white leaves the tank leaves the suit and throws a bucket of black paint just to hide the face of the monster so i come with my and i spray them on the suit on the tank and on the whole wall and this is how it stands today until further notice,True,True,good,,,,,,

let me remind you what we already know we have a population that is both growing and aging we have seven billion souls today heading to billion at the end of the century we consume natural resources faster than they can be replenished and the emissions that are mainly responsible for climate change just keep increasing now clearly these are environmental and social issues but that is not all theyre economic issues and that makes them relevant to risk and return and they are really complex and they can seem really far off that the temptation may be to do this bury our heads in the sand and not think about it resist this if you can dont do this at home,True,True,good,,,,,,
i mean let me clarify something right panies and investors are not singularly responsible for the fate of the planet they dont have indefinite social obligations and prudent investing and finance theory arent subordinate to sustainability theyre compatible so im not talking about tradeoffs here but institutional investors are the x factor in sustainability why do they hold the key the answer quite simply is they have the money,True,True,good,,,,,,
man in comic what if it is a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing good you like it i like it too,True,False,bad,,,,,,

investors should also look at performance metrics in what we call environment social and governance environment includes energy consumption water availability waste and pollution just making efficient uses of resources social includes human capital things like employee engagement and innovation capacity as well as supply chain management and labor rights and human rights and governance relates to the oversight of companies by their boards and investors see i told you this is the really juicy stuff but is the measure of sustainability and sustainable investing incorporates factors with financial factors into the investment process it means limiting future risk by minimizing harm to people and planet and it means providing capital to users who deploy it towards productive and sustainable outcomes so if sustainability matters financially today and all signs indicate more tomorrow is the private sector paying attention well the really cool thing is that most are they started to see sustainability not just as important but crucial to business success,False,False,good,,,,,,
describing people who chose to vote for as a protest but without thinking through its potential consequences and this disconnect is evident in some of the simplest things say you go out for a quick drink then you decide you wouldnt mind a few more you know youll wake up in the morning feeling awful but you justify it by saying the other me in the future will deal with that but as we find out in the morning that future you is you when i was growing up in india in the late and early there was a feeling that the future both needed to and could actually be planned i remember my parents had to plan for some of the simplest things when they wanted a telephone in our house they needed to order it and then wait wait for nearly five years before it got installed in our house,True,False,bad,,,,,,

the brain is an amazing and complex organ and while many people are fascinated by the brain they cant really tell you that much about the properties about how the brain works because we dont teach neuroscience in schools and one of the reasons why is that the equipment is so complex and so expensive that it is really only done at major universities and large institutions and so in order to be able to access the brain you really need to dedicate your life and spend six and a half years as a graduate student just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools and that is a shame because one out of five of us that is percent of the entire world will have a neurological disorder and there are zero cures for these diseases,False,False,good,,,,,,
was a graduate student my lab mate tim marzullo and myself decided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have for studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough that anyone that you know an amateur or a high school student could learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience and so we did just that a few years ago we started a company called backyard brains and we make neuroscience equipment and i brought some here tonight and i want to do some demonstrations you guys want to see some so i need a volunteer so right before what is your name sam kelly sam,False,False,good,,,,,,

going to show you an example of each of these and im going to start with materials steve who is at the university of pittsburgh about a decade ago had a remarkable idea and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig if you threw away all the cells and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself and he asked a very important question he asked the question if i take that material which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine and i place it somewhere else on a person s body would it give a tissue specific response or would it make small intestine if i tried to make a new ear i wouldnt be telling you this story if it werent compelling the picture im about to show you is a compelling picture,True,False,bad,,,,,,

well now you ramp that up to four and you have a lot of complexity a lot of ways to describe mechanisms so let us talk about what that means so if you look at a human genome they consist of billion of these base pairs that is a lot and they mix up in all different fashions and that makes you a human being if you convert that to binary just to give you a little bit of sizing were actually smaller than the program microsoft office it is not really all that much data i will also tell you were at least as buggy,True,True,good,,,,,,
by the way just so you know you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere that is not genetically modified theyre not grown from seeds theyre grafted into root stock they would not exist in nature on their own so dont worry about dont stress about that stuff weve been doing this forever so we could you know focus on disease resistance we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it or costs we could conceivably expand the climate window we could make pinot noir grow maybe in long island god forbid,True,True,good,,,,,,
lately heard about it at least you probably hear about these days i thought id take a moment to tell you what a genome is it is sort of like if you ask people well what is a megabyte or megabit and what is broadband people never want to say i really dont understand so i will tell you right off of the bat,False,False,good,,,,,,

it is mainly starch and starch when you break it down what is starch it is thank you sugar yes so a baker and a good baker knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch with whole grain bread you have other obstacles youve got bran which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber for the bran is fiber it is got germ those are the good things but those arent the parts of the wheat so whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads and people dont like to eat quote health food they like to eat healthy and but when we think of something as a health food we think of it as something we eat out of obligation not out of passion and love for the flavor and ultimately the challenge of the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every chef is to deliver flavor,False,False,good,,,,,,
cricket wasnt always this speed driven generations game there was a time when you played cricket you played timeless test matches when you played on till the game got over and there was this game in march that started on the third of march and ended on the of march and it only ended because the english had to go from durban to cape town which is a two hour train journey to catch the ship that left on the because the next ship wasnt around for a long time so the match was ended in between and one of the english said you know what another half an hour and we would have won,True,True,good,,,,,,

the indians flew in dwayne bravo from trinidad and tobago overnight and when he had to go back to represent the west indies they asked him when do you have to reach he said i have to be there by a certain time so i have to leave today we said no no no it is not about when you have to leave it is about when do you have to reach there and so he said ive got to reach on date x and they said fine you play to date x minus one so he played in hyderabad went straight after the game went from the stadium to hyderabad airport sat in a private corporate jet first refueling in portugal second refueling in brazil he was in west indies in time,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but slowly the game moved on you know finally you dont always have five days so we moved on and we started playing cricket and then an enormous accident took place in indian sport we dont make things happen accidents happen and were in the right place at the right time sometimes and we won this world cup in,False,False,good,,,,,,
in indian sport we dont make things happen accidents happen and were in the right place at the right time sometimes and we won this world cup in and suddenly we fell in love with the game and we played it virtually every day there was more cricket than anywhere but there was another big date was when we won the world cup we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at india rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country and so we allowed multinationals into india we cut customs duties we reduced import duties and we got all the multinationals coming in with multinational budgets who looked at per capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in india and were looking for a vehicle to reach every indian,False,False,good,,,,,,
there are only two vehicles in india one real one scripted the scripted one is what you see in the movies the real one was cricket and so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me ravi from pepsi decided he is going to take it all over the world and pepsi was this big revolution because they started taking cricket all over and so cricket started becoming big cricket started bringing riches in television started covering cricket for a long time television said we wont cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it,False,False,good,,,,,,
and so we launched our own league six weeks city versus city it was a new thing for us we had only ever supported our country the only two areas in which india was very proud about their country representing itself on the field one was war the indian army which we dont like to happen very often the other was indian cricket,False,False,good,,,,,,
we had only ever supported our country the only two areas in which india was very proud about their country representing itself on the field one was war the indian army which we dont like to happen very often the other was indian cricket now suddenly we had to support city leagues but the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the west america is a home of leagues and they said right well build some glitzy leagues here in india but was india ready for it because cricket for a long time in india was always organized it was never promoted it was never sold it was organized,False,False,good,,,,,,
what it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket all along if you wanted a young you picked him up from the of your own little locality your own city and you were very proud of the system that produced those now all of the sudden if you were to bowl a shot if were to bowl a shot for example they neednt go to or park or somewhere to source them they could go to trinidad this was the new india wasnt it this was the new world where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price and all of a sudden indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world,False,False,good,,,,,,
we are thinking big but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in indian cricket which is cricket and the movies in indian entertainment there is cricket and the movies,False,False,good,,,,,,
well you know sometimes the most important things come in the smallest packages i am going to try to convince you in the minutes i have that microbes have a lot to say about questions such as are we alone and they can tell us more about not only life in our solar system but also maybe beyond and this is why i am tracking them down in the most impossible places on earth in extreme environments where conditions are really pushing them to the brink of survival actually sometimes me too when im trying to follow them too close but here s the thing we are the only advanced civilization in the solar system but that doesnt mean that there is no microbial life nearby in fact the planets and moons you see here could host life all of them and we know that and it is a strong possibility,False,False,good,,,,,,

i felt my passion heart and soul had left my body i felt i was not alive anymore so i started to consider what i should do and i thought i wanted to make my performance better and to show onstage how spectacular the yo yo could be to change the public s image of the yo yo so i quit my company and started a career as a professional performer,False,False,good,,,,,,
i live in south central this is south central liquor stores fast food vacant lots so the city planners they get together and they figure theyre going to change the name south central to make it represent something else so they change it to south los angeles like this is going to fix what is really going wrong in the city this is south los angeles,True,False,bad,,,,,,
what happened i have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood to change the community you have to change the composition of the soil we are the soil youd be surprised how kids are affected by this gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do especially in the inner city plus you get strawberries,True,True,good,,,,,,
there is another time when i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown los angeles these are the guys they helped me unload the truck it was cool and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother and it was just cool to see how this changed them if it was only for that one moment so green grounds has gone on to plant maybe gardens weve had like people come to our dig ins and participate and it is all volunteers if kids grow kale kids eat kale,True,True,good,,,,,,
my plans this is what i want to do i want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes now dont get me wrong im not talking about no free shit because free is not sustainable the funny thing about sustainability you have to sustain it,True,True,good,,,,,,
i got tired of seeing this happening and i was wondering how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood i see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars i see dialysis centers popping up like starbucks and i figured this has to stop so i figured that the problem is the solution food is the problem and food is the solution plus i got tired of driving minutes round trip to get an apple that wasnt impregnated with pesticides so what i did i planted a food forest in front of my house,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what i did i planted a food forest in front of my house it was on a strip of land that we call a parkway it is feet by feet thing is it is owned by the city but you have to maintain it so im like cool i can do whatever the hell i want since it is my responsibility and i gotta maintain it and this is how i decided to maintain it,False,False,good,,,,,,

by chance my other job was with the argentinian national rowing team and i felt that was my thing here everything was twice as hard ill never forget the first day i did the warm up with the team i lined them up in front of me i used to do that with the rowing team and i said ok everyone bend down going like this when i looked up two guys were seated three were lying down and others were squatting,True,True,good,,,,,,
were training at where vern and trained for the first time ever we felt like a true national team at the day before the game we were in the lounge discussing strategy and a waiter knocks on the door interrupting our conversation he suggested we go to church he came to invite us to church i tried to get rid of him saying it wasnt a good time that we better leave it for another day he kept insisting asking me to please let him take the guys to church because that day a pastor who performed miracles would be there i was slightly afraid to ask what type of miracles he meant and he replied nonchalantly coach let me take the team to the church and when we return i guarantee that half of them will be able to see,True,False,bad,,,,,,
some of the guys laughed but imagine being a blind person and someone says that to you i didnt know what to say i said nothing it was an awkward silence i didnt want to make him feel bad because he truly believed this could happen one of the players saved me when he stood up and confidently said juan that was the kid s name already told you it is not the best time to go to church besides let me make this clear if we go to that church and i end up being able to see when we return i will beat you so hard if i cant play tomorrow,True,True,good,,,,,,
the guys asked me do they know us do they know were playing some people followed the bus to we arrived and found an amazing scene in the corridor leading from the locker room to the game field i was walking with silvio who was holding onto my shoulder so i could guide him fortunately there were no gates along the way,True,False,bad,,,,,,
they drank mate and could pour it without burning themselves in the process but when i saw them playing soccer that was amazing they had a dirt field rusty and broken nets the blind who attended the institute would play their games there just like i did at a field near my house,False,False,good,,,,,,
they had a dirt field rusty and broken nets the blind who attended the institute would play their games there just like i did at a field near my house but they played without being able to see the ball made a sound so they could locate it they had a guide behind the rival team s goal to know where to kick the ball and they used eye masks there were guys who could still see a little and they wore eye masks so everyone was equal when i was more at ease with them i asked for a mask myself i put it on and tried to play,False,False,good,,,,,,
how could i do here the same things i was doing there it took me a while i started looking for tools to learn from them from the teachers who worked with them i learned i couldnt explain a play on a like a coach does but i could use a plastic tray and some bottle caps so they could follow me by way of touch i also learned they could run on a track if i ran with them holding a rope so we started looking for volunteers to help us run with them,False,False,good,,,,,,
and there came a time when it became the most fascinating job id ever had i think that is when i wondered why couldnt we be a high performance team as well of course one thing was missing i needed to find out what they wanted the real protagonists of this story three hours of training playing soccer on that field were not going to be enough we would have to train differently,False,False,good,,,,,,
started to train harder and the results were great they asked for more i came to understand that they too wondered why they couldnt do high performance when we felt ready we knocked at door is the national center for high performance sports here in argentina it was hard to get them to hear what we had to say but it was considerably more difficult to get the other athletes training there to consider us their equals in fact they would let us use the field only when no other teams were using it,False,False,good,,,,,,
but it was considerably more difficult to get the other athletes training there to consider us their equals in fact they would let us use the field only when no other teams were using it and we were known as the blind ones not everyone knew exactly what we were doing there the world championship was a turning point in the team s history it was held in buenos aires for the first time it was our chance to show everyone what we had been doing all that time we made it to the finals we were growing as a team,False,False,good,,,,,,
at the same time if you think about it there is all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us think about something like and mountain climbing if you read books of people who climb mountains difficult mountains do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness no they are full of misery in fact it is all about frostbite and having difficulty walking and difficulty breathing cold challenging circumstances and if people were just trying to be happy the moment they would get to the top they would say this was a terrible mistake ill never do it again,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we took a sheet of paper with random letters and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other that was the task people did the first sheet then we asked if they wanted to do another for a little less money the next sheet for a little bit less and so on and so forth and we had three conditions in the first condition people wrote their name on the sheet found all the pairs of letters gave it to the experimenter the experimenter would look at it scan it from top to bottom say uh huh and put it on the pile next to them in the second condition people did not write their name on it the experimenter looked at it took the sheet of paper did not look at it did not scan it and simply put it on the pile of pages so you take a piece you just put it on the side in the third condition the experimenter got the sheet of paper and put it directly into a shredder,True,True,good,,,,,,
the good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done scanning it and saying uh huh that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people s motivations so the good news is that adding motivation doesnt seem to be so difficult the bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy and if we dont think about it carefully we might overdo it so this is all in terms of negative motivation or eliminating negative motivation the next part i want to show you is something about positive motivation so there is a store in the u s called ikea and ikea is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble,True,True,good,,,,,,
i dont know about you but every time i assemble one of those it takes me much longer it is much more it is much more confusing i put things in the wrong way i cant say i enjoy those pieces i cant say i enjoy the process but when i finish it i seem to like those ikea pieces of furniture more than i like other ones,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now you had to break the eggs and add them you had to measure the milk and add it mixing it now it was your cake now everything was fine,True,True,good,,,,,,
so for some people we gave the same task for some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions at the top of the sheet we had little diagrams of how you fold for some people we just eliminated that so now this was tougher what happened well in an objective way the now was uglier it was more difficult now when we looked at the easy we saw the same thing builders loved it more loved it less when you looked at the hard instructions the effect was larger why because now the builders loved it even more,True,True,good,,,,,,
this extra effort into it and they loved it even less because in reality it was even uglier than the first version,True,True,good,,,,,,
of course this tells you something about how we evaluate things now think about kids imagine i asked you how much would you sell your kids for your memories and associations and so on most people would say for a lot a lot of money,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but imagine this was slightly different imagine if you did not have your kids and one day you went to the park and you met some kids they were just like your kids and you played with them for a few hours and when you were about to leave the parents said hey by the way just before you leave if youre interested theyre for sale,True,True,good,,,,,,
how much would you pay for them now most people say not that much and this is because our kids are so valuable not just because of who they are but because of us because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection by the way if you think ikea instructions are not good what about the instructions that come with kids those are really tough,True,True,good,,,,,,
it suggests that we care about the fight about the challenge it suggests that there is all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways,False,False,good,,,,,,
and for me personally i started thinking about this after a student came to visit me this was one of my students from a few years earlier and he came one day back to campus and he told me the following story he said that for more than two weeks he was working on a presentation he was working in a big bank and this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition and he was working very hard on this presentation graphs tables information he stayed late at night every day and the day before it was due he sent his presentation to his boss and his boss wrote him back and said nice presentation but the merger is canceled,False,False,good,,,,,,
and to start with we created a little experiment in which we gave people and we asked them to build with and for some people we gave them and we said hey would you like to build this for three dollars well pay you three dollars for it and people said yes and they built with these and when they finished we took it we put it under the table and we said would you like to build another one this time for if they said yes we gave them another one and when they finished we asked them do you want to build another one for and so on until at some point people said no more it is not worth it for me this was what we called the meaningful condition,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is not worth it for me this was what we called the meaningful condition people built one after another after they finished every one of them we put them under the table and we told them that at the end of the experiment we will take all these we will disassemble them we will put them back in the boxes and we will use it for the next participant there was another condition this other condition was inspired by david my student and this other condition we called the condition and if you remember the story about was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill and when he almost got to the end the rock would roll over and he would have to start again,False,False,good,,,,,,
now what happens when you compare these two conditions the first thing that happened was that people built many more eleven in the meaningful condition versus seven in the condition and by the way we should point out that this was not big meaning people were not curing cancer or building bridges people were building for a few cents and not only that everybody knew that the would be destroyed quite soon so there was not a real opportunity for big meaning but even the small meaning made a difference now we had another version of this experiment,False,False,good,,,,,,
now we had another version of this experiment in this other version of the experiment we didnt put people in this situation we just described to them the situation much as i am describing to you now and we asked them to predict what the result would be what happened people predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude people who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more so people understand that meaning is important they just dont understand the magnitude of the importance the extent to which it is important there was one other piece of data we looked at if you think about it there are some people who love and some people who dont and you would speculate that the people who love would build more even for less money because after all they get more internal joy from it,False,False,good,,,,,,
there was one other piece of data we looked at if you think about it there are some people who love and some people who dont and you would speculate that the people who love would build more even for less money because after all they get more internal joy from it and the people who love less would build less because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower and that is actually what we found in the meaningful condition there was a very nice correlation between the love of and the amount of people built what happened in the condition in that condition the correlation was zero there was no relationship between the love of and how much people built which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people s eyes we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity we basically eliminated it soon after i finished running this experiment i went to talk to a big software company in seattle,False,False,good,,,,,,
this was a group within the software company that was put in a different building and they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company and the week before i showed up the of this big software company went to that group engineers and canceled the project and i stood there in front of of the most depressed people ive ever talked to and i described to them some of these lego experiments and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment and i asked them i said how many of you now show up to work later than you used to and everybody raised their hand i said how many of you now go home earlier than you used to everybody raised their hand i asked them how many of you now add not things to your expense reports and they didnt raise their hands but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports and then i asked them i said what could the have done to make you not as depressed and they came up with all kinds of ideas they said the could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do,False,False,good,,,,,,
they said the could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do he could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization he could have asked them to build some next generation prototypes and see how they would work but the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation and i think the basically did not understand the importance of meaning if the just like our participants thought the essence of meaning is unimportant then he wouldnt care and he would say at the moment i directed you in this way and now that im directing you in this way everything will be okay but if you understood how important meaning is then you would figure out that it is actually important to spend some time energy and effort in getting people to care more about what theyre doing,False,False,good,,,,,,
now along derek and i met when he was four and a half years old and at first derek i thought you were mad to be honest because when you played the piano you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way so as soon as i tried to get near the piano i was firmly shoved off and having said to your dad nic that i would try to teach you i was then slightly confused as to how i might go about that if i wasnt allowed near the piano but after a while i thought well the only way is to just pick you up shove derek over to the other side of the room and in the seconds that i got before derek came back i could just play something very quickly for him to learn and in the end derek i think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together as you can see there is me in my early pre marriage days with a brown beard and little derek concentrating there i just realized this is going to be recorded isnt it right okay,True,True,good,,,,,,
going to l a soon and it is a milestone because it means that derek and i will have spent over hours on long haul flights together which is quite interesting isnt it derek very interesting adam yes long haul flights yes you may think hours is a long time to keep talking but derek does it effortlessly now then,True,True,good,,,,,,
i promise there wont be too much of me talking and a lot of derek playing but i thought it would just be nice to recap on how derek got to where he is today it is amazing now because he is so much bigger than me but when derek was born he could have fitted on the palm of your hand he was born three and a half months premature and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive he had to have a lot of oxygen and that affected your eyes derek and also the way you understand language and the way you understand the world but that was the end of the bad news because when derek came home from the hospital his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you derek really for the rest of your childhood and great insight really was to think here s a child who cant see,False,False,good,,,,,,
but that was the end of the bad news because when derek came home from the hospital his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny who was going to look after you derek really for the rest of your childhood and great insight really was to think here s a child who cant see music must be the thing for derek and sure enough she sang or as derek called it to him for his first few years of life and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe you know in his brain something was stirring some sort of musical gift here s a little picture of derek going up now when you were with your nanny now great other insight was to think perhaps we should get derek something to play and sure enough she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft never thinking really that anything much would come of it but derek your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bashed it bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break but out of all the bashing after a few months emerged the most fantastic music and i think there was just a miracle moment really derek when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard,False,False,good,,,,,,
i need to make a confession at the outset here a little over years ago i did something that i regret something that im not particularly proud of something that in many ways i wish no one would ever know but here i feel kind of obliged to reveal,True,False,bad,,,,,,

is this some kind of touchy feely socialist conspiracy going on here no these are economists from mit from carnegie mellon from the university of chicago do you know who sponsored this research the federal reserve bank of the united states that is the american experience let us go across the pond to the london school of economics london school of economics alma mater of eleven nobel laureates in economics training ground for great economic thinkers like george soros and friedrich hayek and mick jagger,True,True,good,,,,,,
a few times a year they tell their engineers go for the next hours and work on anything you want as long as it is not part of your regular job work on anything you want engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code come up with an elegant hack then they present all of the stuff that theyve developed to their teammates to the rest of the company in this wild and woolly all hands meeting at the end of the day being australians everybody has a beer they call them fedex days why because you have to deliver something overnight it is pretty not bad it s a huge trademark violation but it is pretty clever,True,True,good,,,,,,
i want to make a case i want to make a hard headed evidence based dare i say lawyerly case for rethinking how we run our businesses so ladies and gentlemen of the jury take a look at this this is called the candle problem,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is created in by a psychologist named karl he created this experiment that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science and here s how it works suppose im the experimenter i bring you into a room i give you a candle some and some matches and i say to you your job is to attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesnt drip onto the table now what would you do many people begin trying to the candle to the wall doesnt work,False,False,good,,,,,,
the key is to overcome what is called functional you look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks but it can also have this other function as a platform for the candle the candle problem i want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem done by a scientist named sam who is now at princeton university us this shows the power of incentives he gathered his participants and said im going to time you how quickly you can solve this problem,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you want people to perform better you reward them right bonuses commissions their own reality show them that is how business works but that is not happening here,False,False,good,,,,,,
that is how business works but that is not happening here youve got an incentive designed to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity and it does just the opposite it thinking and blocks creativity what is interesting about this experiment is that it is not an aberration this has been replicated over and over again for nearly years these contingent if you do this then you get that work in some circumstances but for a lot of tasks they actually either dont work or often they do harm this is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored,False,False,good,,,,,,
i spent the last couple of years looking at the science of human motivation particularly the dynamics of extrinsic and intrinsic and im telling you it is not even close if you look at the science there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does what is alarming here is that our business operating system think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses how we motivate people how we apply our human resources it is built entirely around these extrinsic around carrots and sticks that is actually fine for many kinds of century tasks but for century tasks that mechanistic reward approach doesnt work often doesnt work and often does harm let me show you,False,False,good,,,,,,
so for tasks like this a narrow focus where you just see the goal right there zoom straight ahead to it they work really well but for the real candle problem you dont want to be looking like this the solution is on the periphery you want to be looking around,False,False,good,,,,,,
that rule based left brain work certain kinds of accounting financial analysis computer programming has become fairly easy to outsource fairly easy to automate software can do it faster low cost providers can do it cheaper so what really matters are the more right brained creative conceptual kinds of abilities,False,False,good,,,,,,
are the problems that you face or even the problems weve been talking about here do they have a clear set of rules and a single solution no the rules are mystifying the solution if it exists at all is surprising and not obvious everybody in this room is dealing with their own version of the candle problem,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is just a sack of chemicals that is able to have this interesting and complex lifelike behavior if we count the number of chemicals in that system actually including the water that is in the dish we have five chemicals that can do this so then we put these together in a single experiment to see what they would do and depending on the conditions we have some on the left that are moving around and it likes to touch the other structures in its environment on the other hand we have two moving that like to circle each other and they form a kind of a dance a complex dance with each other right so not only do individual have behavior what weve interpreted as behavior in this system but we also have basically population level behavior similar to what organisms have so now that youre all experts on were going to play a game with these were going to make two different kinds a has a certain kind of chemistry inside that when activated the starts to vibrate around just dancing so remember these are primitive things so dancing that is very interesting to us,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so then i repeated this experiment a bunch of times and one time something very interesting happened so i added these together to the system and a and b fused together to form a hybrid ab that didnt happen before there it goes there is a ab now in this system ab likes to dance around for a bit while b does the fusing okay but then something even more interesting happens watch when these two large the hybrid ones fuse together now we have a dancing and a self replication event right,True,True,good,,,,,,
so were able to then see the self assembly of these oil droplet bodies again that weve seen previously and the black spots inside of there represent this kind of black tar this diverse very complex organic black tar and we put them into one of these experiments as youve seen earlier and then we watch lively movement that comes out they look really good very nice movement and also they appear to have some kind of behavior where they kind of circle around each other and follow each other similar to what weve seen before but again working with just primordial conditions no pure chemicals these are also these tar fueled are also able to locate resources in their environment im going to add some resource from the left here that into the system and you can see they really like that they become very energetic and able to find the resource in the environment similar to what we saw before but again these are done in these primordial conditions really messy conditions not sort of sterile laboratory conditions these are very dirty little as a matter of fact,True,True,good,,,,,,
there has been a huge divide between what people consider to be non living systems on one side and living systems on the other side so we go from say this beautiful and complex crystal as non life and this rather beautiful and complex cat on the other side over the last hundred and fifty years or so science has kind of blurred this distinction between non living and living systems and now we consider that there may be a kind of continuum that exists between the two well just take one example here a virus is a natural system right but it is very simple it s very simplistic,False,False,good,,,,,,
what were going to be talking about here tonight are experiments done on this sort of non living end of this spectrum so actually doing chemical experiments in the laboratory mixing together ingredients to make new structures and that these new structures might have some of the characteristics of living systems really what im talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life so what are these characteristics that im talking about these are them we consider first that life has a body now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment,False,False,good,,,,,,
but here im being told that the piece of music is very quick im being told where to play on the drum im being told which part of the stick to use and im being told the dynamic and im also being told that the drum is without snares snares on snares off so therefore if i translate this piece of music we have this idea and so on my career would probably last about five years,True,False,bad,,,,,,
however what i have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music everything that there isnt time to learn from a teacher or to talk about even from a teacher but it is the things you notice when youre not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting and that you want to explore through this tiny tiny surface of a drum so there we experience the translation now well experience the interpretation now my career may last a little longer,True,True,good,,,,,,
i asked you to clap maybe i can do this if i can just say please clap and create the sound of thunder im assuming weve all experienced thunder now i dont mean just the sound i mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves and please try to create that through your clapping try just please try snow,True,True,good,,,,,,
snow have you ever heard snow no well then stop clapping,True,True,good,,,,,,
again try again snow see youre awake rain,True,True,good,,,,,,
so heavens what was i to do i no longer required the sticks i wasnt allowed to have these sticks i had to basically look at this particular drum see how it was made what these little lugs did what the snares did turned it upside down experimented with the shell experimented with the head experimented with my body experimented with jewelry experimented with all sorts of things and of course i returned with all sorts of bruises,True,True,good,,,,,,
that is my only real aim in life and it sounds quite simple but actually it is quite a big big job because you know when you look at a piece of music for example if i just open my little motorbike bag we have here hopefully a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i read the music so technically i can actually read this i will follow the instructions the tempo markings the dynamics i will do exactly as im told and so therefore because time is short if i just played you literally the first maybe two lines or so it is very straightforward there is nothing too difficult about the piece but here im being told that the piece of music is very quick im being told where to play on the drum,False,False,good,,,,,,
but in a way you know it is the same if i look at you and i see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on i see that youre clutching a teddy bear etc etc so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about what you might like what you might do as a profession etc etc however that is just the initial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look and we try to interpret but actually it is so unbelievably shallow in the same way i look at the music i get a basic idea i wonder what technically might be hard or you know what i want to do,False,False,good,,,,,,
is simply not enough and i think what herbie said please listen listen we have to listen to ourselves first of all if i play for example holding the stick where literally i do not let go of the stick youll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm and you feel really quite believe it or not detached from the instrument and from the stick even though im actually holding the stick quite tightly,False,False,good,,,,,,
holding it tightly i feel strangely more detached if i just simply let go and allow my hand my arm to be more of a support system suddenly i have more dynamic with less effort much more and i just feel at last one with the stick and one with the drum and im doing far far less so in the same way that i need time with this instrument i need time with people in order to interpret them,False,False,good,,,,,,
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger there and so what we would do is that i would put my hands on the wall of the music room and together we would listen to the sounds of the instruments and really try to connect with those sounds far far more broadly than simply depending on the ear because of course the ear is subject to all sorts of things the room we happen to be in the amplification the quality of the instrument the type of sticks etc etc theyre all different same amount of weight but different sound colors,False,False,good,,,,,,
does the happiest man in the world look like he certainly doesnt look like me he looks like this his name is ricard so how do you get to be the happiest man in the world well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain and you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the versus the right prefrontal cortex and happiness measure is off the charts he is by far the happiest man ever measured by science which leads us to a question what was he thinking when he was being measured perhaps something very naughty,True,True,good,,,,,,
the third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth leadership training in for example places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities such as self awareness self mastery empathy and compassion because we believe that leadership begins with character we even created a seven week curriculum on emotion intelligence which we jokingly call searching inside yourself it is less naughty than it sounds so im an engineer by training but im one of the creators and instructors of this course which i find kind of funny because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence what a company,True,True,good,,,,,,
and learning about gave me a new angle to look at my work brain scan shows that compassion is not a passion is something that creates happiness,False,False,good,,,,,,
but what exactly is spider silk spider silk is almost entirely protein nearly all of these proteins can be explained by a single gene family so this means that the diversity of silk types we see today is encoded by one gene family so presumably the original spider ancestor made one kind of silk and over the last million years that one silk gene has duplicated and then diverged specialized over and over and over again to get the large variety of flavors of spider silks that we have today there are several features that all these silks have in common they all have a common design such as theyre all very long theyre sort of long compared to other proteins theyre very repetitive and theyre very rich in the amino acids glycine and to give you an idea of what a spider silk protein looks like this is a dragline silk protein it is just a portion of it from the black widow spider this is the kind of sequence that i love looking at day and night,True,False,bad,,,,,,
spider silks also have a lot of potential for their anti ballistic capabilities silks could be incorporated into body and equipment armor that would be more lightweight and flexible than any armor available today in addition to these applications of spider silks personally i find studying spider silks just fascinating in and of itself i love when im in the laboratory a new spider silk sequence comes in that s just the best,True,True,good,,,,,,
to put that number into perspective here s a graph comparing the species of spiders to the species of primates there are two orders of magnitude more spiders than primates spiders are also extremely old on the bottom here this is the geologic and the numbers on it indicate millions of years from the present so the zero here that would be today,False,False,good,,,,,,
each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot and if you were to trace the fiber back into the spider what you would find is that each spigot connects to its own individual silk gland a silk gland kind of looks like a sac with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside so if you ever have the opportunity to dissect an orb spider and i hope you do what you would find is a bounty of beautiful translucent silk glands inside each spider there are hundreds of silk glands sometimes thousands,False,False,good,,,,,,
so these are the dark ages and the dark ages are the time between when you put away the lego for the last time as a kid and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid s toy started out with my then four oh should buy the kid some lego that stuff s cool walked into the lego store bought him this it s totally appropriate for a four,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i turn to my wife and said who are we buying this for she is like oh us im like okay all right that is cool pretty soon it got a little bit out of control the dining room looked like this you walk there and it hurts so we took a room downstairs in the basement that had been used as sort of an abu annex,True,True,good,,,,,,
i was like yeah i suppose we are so then once you do that youre like oh crap where am i going to put all this so you go to the container store and spend an enormous amount of money and then you start this crazy sorting process that never it is just nuts whatever,False,False,good,,,,,,
there is a whole programming language and robotics tool so if you want to teach someone how to program kid adult whatever it is and the guy that made this he made a slot machine out of lego and i dont mean he made lego that looked like a slot machine i mean he made a slot machine out of lego the insides were lego there is people getting drunk building lego and youve got to finish the thing before you puke there s a whole gray market for lego thousands of home based businesses,False,False,good,,,,,,
kids could be entrepreneurs as well im a big part of a couple organizations called the organization and the young presidents organization i just came back from speaking in barcelona at the global conference and everyone i met over there who is an entrepreneur struggled with school i have out of the signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed so this thing right here is freaking me out,True,False,bad,,,,,,
fit into this other system and try to become a student sorry entrepreneurs arent students we fast track we figure out the game i stole essays i cheated on exams i hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university for consecutive assignments but as an entrepreneur you dont do accounting you hire accountants so i just figured that out earlier,True,True,good,,,,,,
i was forced to get a paper at years old i didnt want a paper but my dad said that is your next business not only did he get me one but i had to get two he wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers which i did then i realized collecting tips is how you made all the money so id collect tips and get payment i would collect for the papers he could just deliver them because then i realized i could make money by this point i was definitely not going to be an employee,True,False,bad,,,,,,
get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk even if it is just in front of their friends and do plays and have speeches those are entrepreneurial traits you want to be nurturing show kids what bad customers or bad employees look like show them grumpy employees when you see grumpy customer service point it out say by the way that guy is a employee and say these are good ones,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if you go into a restaurant and have bad customer service show them what bad customer service looks like,True,False,bad,,,,,,
two years ago i was the highest rated lecturer at entrepreneurial master s program it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world when i was in grade two i won a citywide speaking competition but nobody had ever said hey this kid s a good speaker,False,False,good,,,,,,
it was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs from around the world when i was in grade two i won a citywide speaking competition but nobody had ever said hey this kid s a good speaker he cant focus but he loves walking around and getting people energized no one said get him a coach in speaking they said get me a tutor in what i suck at so as kids show these traits and we need to start looking for them i think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers unfortunately the school system is grooming this world to say let us be a lawyer or let us be a doctor were missing that opportunity because no one ever says hey be an entrepreneur entrepreneurs are people we have a lot of them in this room who have ideas and passions or see these needs in the world and decide to stand up and do it,False,False,good,,,,,,
were missing that opportunity because no one ever says hey be an entrepreneur entrepreneurs are people we have a lot of them in this room who have ideas and passions or see these needs in the world and decide to stand up and do it and we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen we have the ability to get the groups of people around us that want to build that dream with us and i think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age of being entrepreneurial we could change everything in the world that is a problem today every problem out there somebody has the idea for and as a young kid nobody can say it cant happen because youre too dumb to realize that you couldnt figure it out i think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish the old parable give a man a fish you feed him for a day teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime,False,False,good,,,,,,
starting these companies it is these random few people even in popular literature the only book ive ever found and this should be on all your reading lists the only book ive ever found that makes the entrepreneur a hero is atlas shrugged everything else in the world looks at entrepreneurs and says were bad people i look at even my family both my grandfathers and my dad were entrepreneurs,False,False,good,,,,,,
and were a non profit foundation you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and so one tuesday morning last june there we were woke up in the morning the mountain was covered with snow that was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again thanks to mitch kapor were building up there and it is a pretty interesting scene this is on the left there the joyful lady is pat irwin who is the regional head of the national forest service and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there we want a temporary use permit for the clock eventually temporary use permit,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but your emotional affect goes up which is great for having a mythic experience whether you want to or not in fact danny hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he cant do in his head,True,False,bad,,,,,,
in fact there he is that is alexander rose first ascent of the western face to mount washington and a solo ascent at that this discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them we realized that we had to name this thing that alexander discovered how about crevice no,True,False,bad,,,,,,
welcome to feet let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you once upon a time i did a book called how buildings learn today s event you might call how mountains teach a little background for years ive been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare or in some cases non existent it would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter but you know next years and the last years basically story so far,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we have the long now foundation in san francisco it is an incubator for about a dozen projects all having to do with continuity over the long term our core project is a rather ambitious folly i suppose a mythic undertaking to build a clock that can really keep good time for that long a period and the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious go to the clock and what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago it s the first working prototype of the clock,False,False,good,,,,,,
design problem for today is going to be how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick save time beautifully for centuries well this was the first solution alexander rose came up with this idea of a tower with continuous sloping ramps and it looked like a way to go until you start thinking about what does deep time do to a building well this is what deep time does to a building this is the parthenon it is only years old and look what happened to it here s a beautiful project they really knew itd last forever because theyd build it out of absolutely huge stones and now it is a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for that s what happens to buildings,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we got to thinking if you cant put things safely in a building where can you safely put them we thought ok underground how about underground with a view underground in a place that is really solid so the obvious answer was we need a mountain you dont want just any mountain you need absolutely the right mountain if youre going to have a clock for years so here s an image of the long view of the search problem and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest we looked at in new mexico,False,False,good,,,,,,
to be new at ted it is like being the last high school virgin,True,True,good,,,,,,
theyve made a selection theyve chosen a project by daniel the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture child prodigy piano player he started on the and moved to a little more serious issue a bigger instrument and now to an even larger instrument upon which to work his particular brand of magic as you see here he was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of new york was forced to go oh im really sorry we screwed up right can we do this again from the top except use some people with a vague hint of talent instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities let us bring in some real architects for a change and so we got this or we had a choice of that oh stop clapping,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it is a big deal it sounds big it sounds important it sounds solid it sounds american serious male and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time i mean it goes on in our private lives too every single day we all want to go out and buy an audi dont we everyone here must own one or at least they craved one the moment they saw one and then they hopped in it turned the little electronic key rather than the real key zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle,True,True,good,,,,,,
it is exciting and there is music playing all of the time and then suddenly it is over and it is only taken five minutes and you want to go back and do it again but i really appreciate being here,False,False,good,,,,,,
how many of you saw usa today today there it is looks like that there is the world trade center site on the front cover theyve made a selection theyve chosen a project by daniel the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture,False,False,good,,,,,,
this was a scheme by a team called think a new york based team and then there was that one which was the scheme this one this is going to be the new world trade center a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it now i dont know what you think but i think this is a pretty stupid decision because what youve done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever but that is what were going to do,False,False,good,,,,,,
and you peak out likewise with solar especially here in california were discovering that the solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze square miles of southern california desert well as an environmentalist we would rather that didnt happen it is okay on out agricultural land wonderful on rooftops but out in the landscape one is on the order of square miles of bulldozed desert when you add all these things up saul griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get clean of energy from wind solar and and that area would be roughly the size of the united states an area he refers to as a guy who is added it up all this very well is david mackay a physicist in england and in his wonderful book sustainable energy among other things he says im not trying to be pro nuclear im just pro arithmetic,True,False,bad,,,,,,
fifteen percent of the entire u s has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost competitive and there is much more solar than there is wind there is plenty of resource you can make it reliable okay so thank you mark so if you were in palm springs,True,True,good,,,,,,
the debate is over the proposition what the world needs now is nuclear energy true or false and before we have the debate id like to actually take a show of hands on balance right now are you for or against this so those who are yes raise your hand for,False,False,good,,,,,,
true or false and before we have the debate id like to actually take a show of hands on balance right now are you for or against this so those who are yes raise your hand for okay hands down those who are against raise your hands okay im reading that at about to in favor at the start which means were going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts if at all so here s the format theyre going to have six minutes each and then after one little quick exchange between them i want two people on each side of this debate in the audience to have seconds to make one short crisp pungent powerful point so in favor of the proposition possibly shockingly is one of truly the founders of the environmental movement a long standing the founder of the whole earth catalog someone we all know and love stewart brand whoa,False,False,good,,,,,,
well the only way to experience zero g on earth is actually with parabolic flight weightless flight you take an airplane you fly over the top youre weightless for e back down you weigh twice as much you do it again and again you can get eight minutes of weightlessness how nasa s trained their astronauts for so long we set out to do this it took us years to become operational and we announced that we were going to fly stephen hawking we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say youre crazy dont do that youre going kill the guy,True,True,good,,,,,,
we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane we were monitoring his of his blood his heart rate his blood pressure we had everything all set in case of an emergency god knows you dont want to hurt this world renowned expert we took off from the shuttle landing facility where the shuttle takes off and lands and my partner byron lichtenberg and i carefully suspended him into zero g once he was there we let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like and after that first parabola you know the doc said everything is great he was smiling and we said go so we did a second parabola,True,True,good,,,,,,
and a third we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did and we did a fourth and a fifth and a sixth,True,True,good,,,,,,
those of you who know me know how passionate i am about opening the space frontier so when i had the chance to give the world s expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity it was incredible and i want to tell you that story i first met him through the x prize for it is a competition were holding the second x prize for the first team to sequence human in days we have something called the genome individuals were sequencing as part of that,False,False,good,,,,,,
and he wanted to go we worked hard to get all the permissions and six months later we sat down at kennedy space center we had a press conference we announced our intent to do one zero g parabola give him seconds of zero g and if it went really well we might do three well we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this and what he said for me was very moving,False,False,good,,,,,,
he said life on earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster i think the human race doesnt have a future if it doesnt go into space i therefore want to encourage public interest in space we took him out to the kennedy space center up inside the nasa vehicle into the back of the zero g airplane we had about people who made donations we raised in donations for children s charities who flew with us a few here we set up a whole er,False,False,good,,,,,,
so my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the proceedings of the national academies if you this youll find it it is four pages easy to read and they looked at just people s likes so just the things you like on and used that to predict all these attributes along with some other ones and in their paper they listed the five likes that were most indicative of high intelligence and among those was liking a page for curly fries,True,True,good,,,,,,
this is an figure one sheet no cuts folding only hundreds of folds this too is and this shows where weve gone in the modern world naturalism detail you can get horns antlers even if you look close hooves and it raises a question what changed and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art which is math that is people applied mathematical principles to the art to discover the underlying laws and that leads to a very powerful tool the secret to productivity in so many fields and in is letting dead people do your work for you,True,True,good,,,,,,
but if we follow the laws of we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very very simple but when we put it together we get something a little different this fish scales again it is one uncut square only folding and if you dont want to fold scales you can back off and just do a few things and add plates to the back of a turtle or toes or you can ramp up and go up to stars on a flag with stripes and if you want to go really crazy scales on a rattlesnake and this guy s on display downstairs so take a look if you get a chance the most powerful tools in have related to how we get parts of creatures and i can put it in this simple equation we take an idea combine it with a square and you get an figure,True,True,good,,,,,,
and here s where the dead people start to help us out because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles i can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc and arrangements and i can use those patterns now to create shapes so we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles you decorate the patterns of circles with lines according to more rules that gives you the folds those folds fold into a base you shape the base you get a folded shape in this case a cockroach and it is so simple,True,True,good,,,,,,
it is so simple that a computer could do it and you say well you know how simple is that but computers you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms and with this we could so i wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called and you can download it from my website it is free it runs on all the major platforms even windows,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this tree frog has toes actually lots of people in now put toes into their models toes have become an because everyone s doing it you can make multiple subjects so these are a couple of instrumentalists the guitar player from a single square the bass player from a single square and if you say well but the guitar bass that is not so hot do a little more complicated instrument well then you could do an organ,True,False,bad,,,,,,
my talk is flapping birds and space telescopes and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another but i hope by the end of these minutes youll see a little bit of a relation it ties to so let me start what is most people think they know what is,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let me start what is most people think they know what is it is this flapping birds toys catchers that sort of thing and that is what used to be but it is become something else it is become an art form a form of sculpture the common theme what makes it is folding is how we create the form you know it is very old this is a plate from,False,False,good,,,,,,
you know it is very old this is a plate from it shows these women playing with these toys if you look close it is this shape called a crane every japanese kid learns how to fold that crane so this art has been around for hundreds of years and you would think something that is been around that long so restrictive folding only everything that could be done has been done a long time ago and that might have been the case but in the twentieth century a japanese folder named came along and he created tens of thousands of new designs but even more importantly he created a language a way we could communicate a code of dots dashes and arrows,False,False,good,,,,,,
take your problem and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved and use their solutions and i want to tell you how we did that in revolves around crease patterns the crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an figure and you cant just draw them arbitrarily they have to obey four simple laws,False,False,good,,,,,,
and you cant just draw them arbitrarily they have to obey four simple laws and theyre very simple easy to understand the first law is two you can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting the directions of the folds at any vertex the number of mountain folds the number of valley folds always differs by two two more or two less nothing else if you look at the angles around the fold you find that if you number the angles in a circle all the even numbered angles add up to a straight line all the odd numbered angles add up to a straight line,False,False,good,,,,,,
are right now in a marriage revolution we are shedding years of our farming tradition and moving forward towards egalitarian relationships between the sexes something i regard as highly compatible with the ancient human spirit im not a pollyanna there is a great deal to cry about ive studied divorce in cultures ive studied as i say adultery in many there is a whole pile of problems as william butler yeats the poet once said love is the crooked thing i would add nobody gets out alive,True,True,good,,,,,,
on the paradox of choice you know on the one hand we relish the novelty and the playfulness i think to be able to have so many options and at the same time as you talk about this cognitive overload i see many many people who who dread the uncertainty and self doubt that comes with this massa of choice creating a case of and then leading us fear of missed opportunity or fear of missing out it is like how do i know i have found the right one so weve created what i call this thing of stable ambiguity stable ambiguity is when you are too afraid to be alone but also not really willing to engage in intimacy building it is a set of tactics that kind of prolong the uncertainty of a relationship but also the uncertainty of the breakup so here on the internet you have three major ones one is icing and simmering which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasizes the undefined nature of a relationship but at the same time gives you enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom of the undefined boundaries,True,False,bad,,,,,,
yeah and then comes and is basically you disappear from this massa of texts on the spot and you dont have to deal with the pain that you inflict on another because youre making it invisible even to yourself,True,False,bad,,,,,,
no the basic thing is over percent of people want somebody that respects them somebody they can trust and confide in somebody who makes them laugh somebody who makes enough time for them and somebody who they find physically attractive that never changes and there is certainly you know there is two parts but you know how i call that that is not what people used to say that is exactly right they said they wanted somebody with whom they have companionship economic support children we went from a production economy to a service economy,True,True,good,,,,,,
we are a pair bonding species ninety seven percent of mammals do not pair up to rear their young human beings do im not suggesting that were not that were necessarily sexually faithful to our partners ive looked at adultery in cultures i understand actually some of the genetics of it and some of the brain circuitry of it it is very common around the world but we are built to love how is technology changing love im going to say almost not at all i study the brain,False,False,good,,,,,,
i keep telling them and they agree with me that these are not dating sites they are introducing sites when you sit down in a bar in a coffee house on a park bench your ancient brain snaps into action like a sleeping cat awakened and you smile and laugh and listen and parade the way our ancestors did years ago we can give you various people all the dating sites can but the only real algorithm is your own human brain technology is not going to change that technology is also not going to change who you choose to love i study the biology of personality and ive come to believe that weve evolved four very broad styles of thinking and behaving linked with the dopamine serotonin testosterone and estrogen systems so i created a questionnaire directly from brain science to measure the degree to which you express the traits the constellation of traits linked with each of these four brain systems i then put that questionnaire on various dating sites in countries fourteen million or more people have now taken the questionnaire and ive been able to watch who is naturally drawn to whom,False,False,good,,,,,,
come to think that due to this cognitive overload were ushering in a new form of courtship that i call slow love i arrived at this during my work with every year for the last six years weve done a study called singles in america we dont poll the match population we poll the american population we use people a representative sample of americans based on the us census weve got data now on over people and every single year i see some of the same patterns every single year when i ask the question over percent of people have had a one night stand not necessarily last year but in their lives percent have had a friends with benefits during the course of their lives and over percent have lived with a person long term before marrying americans think that this is reckless,False,False,good,,,,,,
in fact the greatest change in modern romance and family life is not technology it is not even slow love it is actually women piling into the job market in cultures around the world for millions of years our ancestors lived in little hunting and gathering groups women commuted to work to gather their fruits and vegetables they came home with to percent of the evening meal the double income family was the rule,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this is a work called the sun shadow and it was almost like a sheet of paper like a cutout of a childlike drawing of an oil spill or a sun and from the front this object appeared to be very strong and robust and from the side it almost seemed very weak so people would walking into the room and theyd almost ignore it thinking it was some crap laying around but as soon as they passed by it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion and it would get exhausted and it would collapse every time,True,True,good,,,,,,
today im going to take you through glimpses of about eight of my projects done in collaboration with danish artist we call ourselves and rao and we live and work in india id like to begin with my very first object which i call the uncle phone and it was inspired by my uncle s peculiar habit of constantly asking me to do things for him almost like i were an extension of his body to turn on the lights or to bring him a glass of water a pack of cigarettes and as i grew up it became worse and worse and i started to think of it as a form of control,False,False,good,,,,,,

it is an amalgam of wood and cast iron and felt and steel strings and all these and theyre all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity so when you go into the recording session you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to there is the whole action there sitting kind of on the side and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano without putting dates next to these things step music will be turned into data like every field that is occurred in the past or years audio has come very late to this game im not talking about digitizing and bits and re mastering im talking about turn it into the data that it was made from which is how it was performed and audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool theyre high resolution and theyre wired straight to our emotions and you cant trick them very easily your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement you know all right there is this episode of star trek,True,False,bad,,,,,,
ninety nine percent of us have the dream of listeners not being the musicians the listeners right and we crave one thing even though we kind of dont know it all the time we crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded the day it was played and we go to live concerts and we get that as much as we can but then we listen to the other percent of our stuff recorded,False,False,good,,,,,,
a polar bear swimming in the arctic by paul polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth theyre not very good swimmers and we know what is happening to the ice these are camels moving across the rift valley in africa photographed by chris johns shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels this is a rancher in texas by william albert allard a great and jane goodall making her own special connection photographed by nick nichols this is a soap disco in spain photographed by david alan harvey and david said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor but hey at least it s,True,True,good,,,,,,
i can see his hands reaching out and i can see his face in terror looking at me saying help me dad i got him the wave broke over us we got back on shore he was fine we were a little bit rattled but this flashbulb memory as it is called is when all the elements came together to define not just the event but my emotional connection to it and this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer now i have to tell you i was talking to kyle last week about this that i was going to tell this story and he said oh yeah i remember that too i remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me,True,True,good,,,,,,
photographer nick nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in chad called the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale and that is what nick did up to a point this is a cat he is actually taking his own picture shot with what is called a camera trap there is an infrared beam that is going across and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph these are baboons at a watering hole nick the camera again an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this and nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons,True,True,good,,,,,,
now these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics but there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are when it comes down to it just plain fun photographer paul nicklin traveled to antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals they have been rarely photographed partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean in fact a year earlier a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed so you can imagine paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water now what leopard seals do mostly is they eat penguins you know of the march of the penguins this is sort of the munch of the penguins,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but then paul got in the water and he said he was never really afraid of this well this one female came up to him she is probably it is a shame you cant see it in the photograph but she is feet long so she is pretty significant in size and paul said he was never really afraid because she was more curious about him than threatened this mouthing behavior on the right was really her way of saying to him hey look how big i am or you know my what big teeth you have,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so what she did was she started to bring penguins to him alive and put them in front of him she dropped them off and then they would swim away shed kind of look at him like what are you doing go back and get them and then bring them back and drop them in front of him and she did this over the course of a couple of days until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head,True,True,good,,,,,,
let us just start by looking at some great photographs this is an icon of national geographic an afghan refugee taken by steve mccurry but the harvard lampoon is about to come out with a parody of national geographic and i shudder to think what theyre going to do to this photograph oh the wrath of this is a jet landing at san francisco by bruce dale he mounted a camera on the tail,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is a jet landing at san francisco by bruce dale he mounted a camera on the tail a poetic image for a story on tolstoy by sam abell pygmies in the by randy olson i love this photograph because it reminds me of bronze sculptures of the little dancer a polar bear swimming in the arctic by paul polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth theyre not very good swimmers and we know what is happening to the ice these are camels moving across the rift valley in africa photographed by chris johns shot straight down so these are the shadows of the camels,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this is a comet captured by dr euan mason and finally the bow of the titanic without movie stars photographed by emory kristof photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today s saturated media world because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment here s an example four years ago i was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches but i turned away for a moment and he got caught into a and started to be pulled out towards the jetty,False,False,good,,,,,,
four years ago i was at the beach with my son and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the delaware beaches but i turned away for a moment and he got caught into a and started to be pulled out towards the jetty i can stand here right now and see as i go tearing into the water after him the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement i can see the rocks are over here there is a wave about to crash onto him i can see his hands reaching out and i can see his face in terror looking at me saying help me dad i got him the wave broke over us we got back on shore he was fine,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this represents this is a cross sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world s greatest working at the very top of their craft except one this photograph was taken by dr euan mason in new zealand last year and it was submitted and published in national geographic last year we added a section to our website called your shot where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication and it has become a wild success tapping into the enthusiast photography community the quality of these amateur photographs can at times be amazing and seeing this reinforces for me that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them,False,False,good,,,,,,
to be a great photojournalist you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you youve got to be able to make them all the time but even more importantly you need to know how to create a visual narrative you need to know how to tell a story so im going to share with you some coverages that i feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography photographer nick nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in chad called the original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species of an exotic locale,False,False,good,,,,,,
and a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den i love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail but the centerpiece species of are the elephants it is one of the largest intact herds in this part of africa here s a photograph shot in moonlight something that digital photography has made a big difference for it was with the elephants that this story pivoted,False,False,good,,,,,,
the deadline for the show arrived my paints didnt i had to do something this fishing village was famous for sculpture so i tried bronze casting but to make large forms was too heavy and expensive i went for a walk on the beach watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand id seen it every day but this time i saw it differently a new approach to sculpture a way to make form without heavy solid materials my first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen it s a self portrait titled wide hips,True,True,good,,,,,,
this story is about taking imagination seriously fourteen years ago i first encountered this ordinary material used the same way for centuries today im using it to create permanent billowing voluptuous forms the scale of hard edged buildings in cities around the world i was an unlikely person to be doing this i never studied sculpture engineering or architecture in fact after college i applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven,False,False,good,,,,,,
i discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns i was mesmerized i continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans next in lithuania with lace makers i liked the fine detail it gave my work but i wanted to make them larger to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in returning to india to work with those fishermen we made a net of a million and a half hand tied knots installed briefly in madrid thousands of people saw it and one of them was the manual sola morales who was redesigning the waterfront in porto portugal,False,False,good,,,,,,
for people in poor countries it is less than one ton it is an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet and somehow we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero it is been constantly going up it is only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to zero this equation has four factors a little bit of multiplication so youve got a thing on the left that you want to get to zero and that is going to be based on the number of people the services each person is using on average the energy on average for each service and the being put out per unit of energy so let us look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero,True,False,bad,,,,,,
them involved in the idea of you know there are people who live with mosquitoes with energy all i could come up with is this i decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year so here we have some natural fireflies im told they dont bite in fact they might not even leave that jar,True,True,good,,,,,,
im going to talk today about energy and climate and that might seem a bit surprising because my full time work at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact more important than to anyone else on the planet the climate getting worse means that many years their crops wont grow there will be too much rain not enough rain things will change in ways their fragile environment simply cant support and that leads to starvation it leads to uncertainty it leads to unrest so the climate changes will be terrible for them,False,False,good,,,,,,
and there is certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be but they will be extremely bad i asked the top scientists on this several times do we really have to get down to near zero cant we just cut it in half or a quarter and the answer is until we get near to zero the temperature will continue to rise and so that is a big challenge it is very different than saying were a twelve truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge and we can just sort of squeeze under this is something that has to get to zero now we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year over billion tons for each american it is about tons for people in poor countries it is less than one ton it s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is my first time at ted normally as an advertising man i actually speak at ted evil which is ted s secret sister that pays all the bills it is held every two years in burma and i particularly remember a really good speech by kim jong il on how to get teens smoking again,True,True,good,,,,,,
im just an ad man but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks here is my naive advertising man s suggestion what you should in fact do is employ all of the world s top male and female supermodels pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey,True,True,good,,,,,,
is another naive advertising man s question again and this shows that engineers medical people scientific people have an obsession with solving the problems of reality when actually most problems once you reach a basic level of wealth in society most problems are actually problems of perception so ill ask you another question what on earth is wrong with placebos they seem fantastic to me they cost very little to develop they work extraordinarily well they have no side effects or if they do theyre imaginary so you can safely ignore them,True,True,good,,,,,,
but actually the point of placebo education is interesting how many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception rather than that tedious hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality here s a great example from history ive heard this attributed to several other kings but doing a bit of historical research it seems to be fredrick the great fredrick the great of prussia was very very keen for the germans to adopt the potato and to eat it because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate wheat and potatoes you get less price volatility in bread and you get a far lower risk of famine because you actually had two crops to fall back on not one the only problem is potatoes if you think about it look pretty disgusting and also century ate very very few vegetables rather like contemporary scottish people,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the prussian peasantry said we cant even get the dogs to eat these damn things they are absolutely disgusting and theyre good for nothing there are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes so he tried plan b he tried the marketing solution which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable and none but the royal family could consume it and he planted it in a royal potato patch with guards who had instructions to guard over it night and day but with secret instructions not to guard it very well,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i cant verify that fully but it does not matter there is your environmental problem solved by the way guys all convicted child molesters have to drive a porsche cayenne,True,True,good,,,,,,
the wealthy to help in the war against the french were encouraged to give in all their jewelry and it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron here s one gold gab ich eisen the interesting thing is that for years hence the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasnt made of gold or diamonds it was made of cast iron because actually never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry this actually had symbolic value badge value it said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past so the modern equivalent would of course be this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it involves limited raw materials and that what we add on top is kind of false it is a fake version and there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it it patently veers toward propaganda however what we do have now is a much more media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value and it is much fairer when i grew up this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food you had a monopoly supplier on the left you have rupert murdoch or the bbc,True,True,good,,,,,,

in terms of dress denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value coca cola a bunch of you may be a load of pinkos and you may not like the coca cola company but it is worth remembering andy warhol s point about coke what warhol said about coke is he said what i really like about coca cola is the president of the united states cant get a better coke than the bum on the corner of the street now that is actually when you think about it we take it for granted it is actually a remarkable achievement to produce something that is that democratic now we basically have to change our views slightly there is a basic view that real value involves making things involves labor it involves engineering it involves limited raw materials,False,False,good,,,,,,
but so much communication now is that the capacity for actually nudging people for giving them better information b j fogg at the university of stanford makes the point that actually the mobile phone is he is invented the phrase persuasive technologies he believes the mobile phone by being location specific timely and immediate is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented now if we have all these tools at our disposal we simply have to ask the question and thaler and have of how we can use these more intelligently ill give you one example if you had a large red button of this kind on the wall of your home and every time you pressed it it saved dollars for you put dollars into your pension you would save a lot more,False,False,good,,,,,,

as of the end of last year men had run under four minutes in the mile but like jesse owens sir roger bannister ran on soft cinders that stole far more energy from his legs than the synthetic tracks of today so i consulted experts to find out how much slower it is to run on cinders than synthetic tracks and their consensus that it is one and a half percent slower so if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub four mile on a synthetic track this is what happens only are left if you look at it from that perspective fewer than ten new men per year have joined the sub four mile club since sir roger bannister now is a lot more than one and that is partly because there are many more people training today and theyre training more intelligently even college kids are professional in their training compared to sir roger bannister who trained for minutes at a time while he ditched gynecology lectures in med school and that guy who won the olympic marathon in three in a half hours that guy was drinking rat poison and brandy while he ran along the course that was his idea of a performance enhancing drug,True,True,good,,,,,,
sports where height is prized like basketball the tall athletes got taller in the national basketball association signed a groundbreaking agreement making players partners in the league entitled to shares of ticket revenues and television contracts suddenly anybody who could be an player wanted to be and teams started scouring the globe for the bodies that could help them win championships almost overnight the proportion of men in the who are at least seven feet tall doubled to percent today one in men in the is at least seven feet tall but a seven man is incredibly rare in the general population so rare that if you know an american man between the ages of and who is at least seven feet tall there is a percent chance he is in the right now,True,True,good,,,,,,
now in some cases the search for bodies that could push athletic performance forward ended up introducing into the competitive world populations of people that werent previously competing at all like kenyan distance runners we think of kenyans as being great kenyans think of the tribe as being great the make up just percent of the kenyan population but the vast majority of elite runners and they happen on average to have a certain unique physiology legs that are very long and very thin at their extremity and this is because they have their ancestry at very low latitude in a very hot and dry climate and an evolutionary adaptation to that is limbs that are very long and very thin at the extremity for cooling purposes it is the same reason that a radiator has long coils to increase surface area compared to volume to let heat out and because the leg is like a pendulum the longer and thinner it is at the extremity the more energy efficient it is to swing to put running success in perspective consider that american men in history have run faster than two hours and minutes in the marathon that is a four pace thirty two men did that last october,True,False,bad,,,,,,
endurance and ultra endurance sports serve as a great example ultra endurance was once thought to be harmful to human health but now we realize that we have all these traits that are perfect for ultra endurance no body fur and a glut of sweat glands that keep us cool while running narrow waists and long legs compared to our frames large surface area of joints for shock absorption we have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring short toes that are better for pushing off than for grasping tree limbs and when we run we can turn our torso and our shoulders like this while keeping our heads straight our primate cousins cant do that they have to run like this and we have big old butt muscles that keep us upright while running have you ever looked at an butt they have no buns because they dont run upright and as athletes have realized that were perfectly suited for ultra endurance theyve taken on feats that would have been unthinkable before athletes like spanish endurance racer here s running up the,True,True,good,,,,,,
the olympic motto is faster higher stronger and athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly the winner of the olympic marathon ran two hours and eight minutes had he been racing against the winner of the olympic marathon he would have won by nearly an hour and a half now we all have this feeling that were somehow just getting better as a human race inexorably progressing but it is not like weve evolved into a new species in a century,False,False,good,,,,,,

the idea of online dating because it is predicated on an algorithm and that is really just a simple way of saying ive got a problem im going to use some data run it through a system and get to a solution so online dating is the second most popular way that people now meet each other but as it turns out algorithms have been around for thousands of years in almost every culture in fact in judaism there were matchmakers a long time ago and though they didnt have an explicit algorithm per se they definitely were running through formulas in their heads like is the girl going to like the boy are the families going to get along what is the rabbi going to say are they going to start having children right away the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this put two people together and that would be the end of it so in my case i thought well will data and an algorithm lead me to my prince charming so i decided to sign on now there was one small catch as im signing on to the various dating as it happens i was really really busy but that actually wasnt the biggest problem the biggest problem is that i hate filling out questionnaires of any kind and i certainly dont like questionnaires that are like cosmo quizzes so i just copied and pasted from my,True,False,bad,,,,,,

youre just being too picky so i said fine from here on out im only going on dates where i know there is fi and im bringing my laptop im going to shove it into my bag im going to have this email template and im going to fill it out and collect information on all these different data points during the date to prove to everybody that empirically these dates really are terrible,True,True,good,,,,,,
so i started tracking things like really stupid awkward sexual remarks bad vocabulary the number of times a man forced me to high five him,True,True,good,,,,,,
so i started to crunch some numbers and that allowed me to make some correlations so as it turns out for some reason men who drink scotch reference kinky sex immediately,True,True,good,,,,,,
so i started writing and writing and writing and at the end i had amassed different data points i wanted somebody was jew ish so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture but wasnt going to force me to go to every friday and saturday i wanted somebody who worked hard because work for me is extremely important but not too hard for me the hobbies that i have are really just new work projects that ive launched i also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children but was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that i do so somebody who was going to be totally okay with forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three and also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it so things like that but i also wanted somebody who would go to far flung exotic places like petra jordan i also wanted somebody who would weigh pounds more than me at all times regardless of what i weighed,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i now have these different data points which to be fair is a lot so what i did was i went through and i prioritized that list i broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points and i ranked everything starting at and going all the way down to and listing things like i was looking for somebody who was really smart who would challenge and stimulate me and balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points these things were also important to me but not necessarily deal breakers,True,False,bad,,,,,,
turns out timing is also really really important just because you have access to somebody s mobile phone number or their instant message account and it is oclock in the morning and you happen to be awake doesnt mean that that is a good time to communicate with those people the popular women on these online sites spend an average of hours in between each communication and that is what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship and finally there were the photos all of the women who were popular showed some skin they all looked really great which turned out to be in sharp contrast to what i had,True,False,bad,,,,,,

it is just not the ones that were being presented with online in fact it is something that you write yourself so whether youre looking for a husband or a wife or youre trying to find your passion or youre trying to start a business all you have to really do is figure out your own framework and play by your own rules and feel free to be as picky as you want well on my wedding day i had a conversation again with my grandmother and she said all right maybe i was wrong it looks like you did come up with a really really great system now your balls they should be fluffy not hard,True,True,good,,,,,,
so my name is amy webb and a few years ago i found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion and i thought what is wrong with me i dont understand why this keeps happening so i asked everybody in my life what they thought i turned to my grandmother who always had plenty of advice and she said stop being so picky youve got to date around,False,False,good,,,,,,

if my strategy was to least expect my way into true love then the variable that i had to deal with was serendipity in short i was trying to figure out what is the probability of my finding mr right well at the time i was living in the city of philadelphia and it is a big city and i figured in this entire place there are lots of possibilities so again i started doing some math population of philadelphia it has million people i figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to,False,False,good,,,,,,
i figure about half of that are men so that takes the number down to im looking for a guy between the ages of and which was only four percent of the population so now im dealing with the possibility of men i was looking for somebody who was jewish because i am and that was important to me that is only percent of the population i figure im attracted to maybe one out of of those men and there was no way i was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer so that basically meant there were men for me that i could possibly date in the entire city of philadelphia in the meantime my very large jewish family was already all married and well on their way to having lots and lots of children and i felt like i was under tremendous peer pressure to get my life going already so i have two possible strategies at this point im sort of figuring out,False,False,good,,,,,,
so obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward but the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date these algorithms had a sea full of men that wanted to take me out on lots of dates what turned out to be truly awful dates there was this guy steve the i t guy the algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets we share a love of math and data and music and so i agreed to go out with him,False,False,good,,,,,,
so steve the i t guy invited me out to one of philadelphia s white extremely expensive restaurants and we went in and right off the bat our conversation really wasnt taking flight but he was ordering a lot of food in fact he didnt even bother looking at the menu he was ordering multiple appetizers multiple for me as well and suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table also lots and lots of bottles of wine so were nearing the end of our conversation and the end of dinner and ive decided steve the i t guy and i are really just not meant for each other but well part ways as friends when he gets up to go to the bathroom and in the meantime the bill comes to our table,False,False,good,,,,,,

there were just bad for me and as it happens the algorithms that were setting us up they werent bad either these algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do which was to take our user generated information in my case my and match it up with other people s information see the real problem here is that while the algorithms work just fine you and i dont when confronted with blank windows where were supposed to input our information online very few of us have the ability to be totally and brutally honest with ourselves the other problem is that these are asking us questions like are you a dog person or a cat person do you like horror films or romance films im not looking for a pen pal im looking for a husband right so there is a certain amount of in that data so i said fine ive got a new plan,False,False,good,,,,,,
as it turns out this worked pretty well so i go back online now i found who is incredibly good looking incredibly well spoken he had hiked mt fuji he had walked along the great wall he likes to travel as long as it doesnt involve a cruise ship and i thought ive done it ive cracked the code i have just found the jewish prince charming of my family s dreams there was only one problem he didnt like me back and i guess the one variable that i havent considered is the competition,False,False,good,,,,,,

you could be swimming right on top of them and not see the they would blend right into the algae which would also fluoresce red but theyve got great vision and they go through this long mating ritual and perhaps theyre using it in that effect but things got pretty edgy when we found green in the because are in the class which includes sharks so im like a coral biologist somebody s got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent and there i am,True,True,good,,,,,,
thinking about i wanted to know how deep does it go does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean so we started using submarines and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here and we dropped down and we noticed one important thing that as we get down to meters it drops off there is no marine life down there below meters almost nothing it is just darkness so it is mainly a shallow phenomenon and below meters we encountered the zone where nine out of animals are actually making their own lights and flashing and blinking as i try to get deeper this is slapping on a one person submarine suit some people call this my jacques cousteau meets woody allen moment,True,True,good,,,,,,
im a marine biologist and an explorer photographer with national geographic but i want to share a secret this image is totally incorrect totally incorrect i see a couple of people crying in the back that ive blown their idea of mermaids all right the mermaid is indeed real but anyone who is gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this it is because the ocean is this massive filter and as soon as you start going underwater youre going to lose your colors and it is going to get dark and blue very quickly but were humans were terrestrial mammals,False,False,good,,,,,,
and looking at it the other way what weve been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us that weve been looking at the blue ocean and it is a crucible of blue and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors and here s just a little sample of what this secret world looks like it is like an underwater light show again what were seeing here is blue light hitting this image these animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light so if you think about it the ocean is percent of the planet and blue light can extend down to almost a meters as we go down underwater after about meters all the red is gone,False,False,good,,,,,,
now to bring that home i thought id invent a little game we dont really have to play it we can just think about it here it is the styrofoam and chocolate game imagine that when we got on this boat we were all given two styrofoam peanuts cant do much with them put them in your pocket suppose the rules are every time you offer somebody a drink you give them the drink and you give them your styrofoam peanuts too whatll happen is that the styrofoam peanuts will start moving through our society here and they will accumulate in the people,True,True,good,,,,,,
it can be a very complicated thing the ocean and it can be a very complicated thing what human health is and bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task but what im going to try to say is that even in that complexity there is some simple themes that i think if we understand we can really move forward and those simple themes arent really themes about the complex science of what is going on but things that we all pretty well know and im going to start with this one if momma aint happy aint nobody happy we know that right weve experienced that,False,False,good,,,,,,
because this is my first time at ted ive decided to bring along an old friend to help break the ice a bit yes that is right this is barbie she is years old and she is looking as young as ever,True,True,good,,,,,,
it turns out that pay transparency sharing salaries openly across a company makes for a better workplace for both the employee and for the organization when people dont know how their pay compares to their theyre more likely to feel underpaid and maybe even discriminated against do you want to work at a place that tolerates the idea that you feel underpaid or discriminated against but keeping salaries secret does exactly that and it is a practice as old as it is common despite the fact that in the united states the law protects an employee s right to discuss their pay in one famous example from decades ago the management of vanity fair magazine actually circulated a memo entitled forbidding discussion among employees of salary received forbidding discussion among employees of salary received now that memo didnt sit well with everybody new york literary figures dorothy parker robert benchley and robert sherwood all writers in the algonquin round table decided to stand up for transparency and showed up for work the next day with their salary written on signs hanging from their neck,True,False,bad,,,,,,
at work how much do you think the person sitting in the cubicle or the desk next to you gets paid do you know should you know notice it is a little uncomfortable for me to even ask you those questions but admit it you kind of want to know most of us are uncomfortable with the idea of broadcasting our salary,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what id like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself because id like to put in context what im going to tell you and i think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education and once i put that in context id like to tell you a little bit about technology why i believe technology is a tremendous enabler a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges then about the initiative that chris mentioned that we decided to launch at that we call and then ill come back to the beginning and tell you a little bit more hopefully convince you that i believe that in today s world it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about but to have a passion for something that is meaningful so with that in mind first of all let me tell you im one of five children im the oldest the other four are women so i grew up in a family of women i learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world,True,False,bad,,,,,,
well one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that people ask me and say well how did your parents treat you when you were a child and i always said that they were really tough on me and not tough in the sense that most people think of where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever they were tough in the sense that as i grew up both my mother and father would always say to me it is really important that you always remember two things first of all when you go to bed at night youve got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could and the second thing they said and we trust you that no matter where you are or where you go you will always do the right thing now i dont know how many of you have ever done that with your kids but if you do please trust me it is the most pressure you can put on a child to say we trust you that you will always do the right thing,True,True,good,,,,,,
you know one of the things that id like to say upfront is that im really here by accident and what i mean not at ted that im at this point in my life truly my set of circumstances i would truly consider an accident but what id like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often because i really think when i look back at how i actually ended up in this accident technology played a big role in that so what id like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself because id like to put in context what im going to tell you and i think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education,False,False,good,,,,,,
but i was fortunate to be able to have one and so were my four sisters that kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education my parents were fanatics about learning and ill come back to that a little bit later but one of the things that exposed me early to learning and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child was through a technology which is on the screen is a my father found that in a junkyard and was able to repair it and make it work and somehow to this day i frankly dont know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world but by inviting me to sit down with him when i was only a few years old and playing records in this by mozart and he would tell me how mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever and how claire de which was one of his favorites was a real exposure to me to classical music,False,False,good,,,,,,
we cleaned up the of beach shown i offered five cents each for bottle caps i got plenty of takers here are the bottle caps they collected i thought i would spend bucks that day i ended up spending nearly i separated them by color and put them on display the next earth day at marine aquarium in san pedro governor schwarzenegger and his wife maria stopped by to discuss the display in spite of my man hat crocheted from plastic shopping bags they shook my hand,True,True,good,,,,,,
let us talk trash you know we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the great depression and world war after the war we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime life magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes mental note to the liberators throwaway plastics take a lot of space and dont only we humans make waste that nature cant digest,False,False,good,,,,,,
now something like this whether we can read it or not needs to be really really clear is it this is a rather recent example of urban clarity that i just love mainly because im always late and i am always in a hurry so when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners i was thrilled because now i finally knew how many seconds i had to get across the street before i got run over by a car six i can do that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery what does this mean this is what it means make it look like something else the visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing applied to something else so that we see it in a different way this is an approach i wanted to take to a book of essays by david that had this title at the time all the beauty you will ever need now the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing it is not connected to any of the essays in the book it came to the author s boyfriend in a dream thank you very much so so usually i am creating a design that is in some way based on the text but this is all the text there is,True,True,good,,,,,,
by mary roach mary roach is an amazing writer who takes potentially mundane scientific subjects and makes them not mundane at all she makes them really fun so in this particular case it is about the human digestive system so im trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be this is a self portrait,True,True,good,,,,,,
but i also started thinking here s our introduction right into the human digestive system but i think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths at least based on this are off putting,True,True,good,,,,,,
this is what i call mystery i go down into the subway i take the subway a lot and this piece of paper is taped to a girder right and now im thinking uh oh and the train s about to come and im trying to figure out what this means and thanks a lot part of the problem here is that theyve compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful and frankly i dont think it is at all so this is mystery we do not need what we need is useful clarity so just for fun i redesigned this this is using all the same elements thank you i am still waiting for a call from the,True,False,bad,,,,,,
right and now im thinking uh oh and the train s about to come and im trying to figure out what this means and thanks a lot part of the problem here is that theyve compartmentalized the information in a way they think is helpful and frankly i dont think it is at all so this is mystery we do not need what we need is useful clarity so just for fun i redesigned this this is using all the same elements thank you i am still waiting for a call from the you know im actually not even using more colors than they use they just didnt even bother to make the and the green those idiots,True,True,good,,,,,,
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so what the hell was that well you dont know because you couldnt understand it it wasnt clear,False,False,good,,,,,,
clarity or mystery im balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer as well as my daily life as a new yorker every day and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me here s an example now how many people know what this is okay,False,False,good,,,,,,
now how many people know what this is okay now how many people know what this is okay thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius charles m schulz we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over years this is actually a cover of a book that i designed about the work of schulz and his art which will be coming out this fall and that is the entire cover there is no other information or visual information on the front and the name of the book is only what is necessary so this is sort of symbolic about the decisions i have to make every day about the design that im perceiving and the design im creating so clarity clarity gets to the point,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let us look at the yin to the clarity yang and that is mystery mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition mystery demands to be and when it is done right we really really want to when should you be mysterious in world war the germans really really wanted to decode this and they couldnt here s an example of a design that ive done recently for a novel by murakami who ive done design work for for over years now and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of a sudden after their freshman year of college completely cut him off with no explanation and he is devastated,False,False,good,,,,,,
essays by david rakoff david rakoff was a wonderful writer and he called his first book fraud because he was getting sent on assignments by magazines to do things that he was not equipped to do so he was this skinny little urban guy and magazine would send him down the colorado river whitewater rafting to see if he would survive and then he would write about it and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself and so i wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself and then somehow show a reader reacting to it this led me to graffiti,False,False,good,,,,,,
a novel by james ellroy okay james ellroy amazing crime writer a good friend ive worked with him for many years he is probably best known as the author of the black dahlia and l a confidential his most recent novel was called this which is a very mysterious name that im sure a lot of people know what it means but a lot of people dont and it is a story about a japanese american detective in los angeles in investigating a murder and then pearl harbor happens and as if his life wasnt difficult enough now the race relations have really ratcheted up and then the japanese american internment camps are quickly created and there is lots of tension and horrible stuff as he is still trying to solve this murder,False,False,good,,,,,,
they started in so there are million in nigeria that play you know and these it is a cd basically it is a compact disc so on the streets are film casts you can be in a lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water yes,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and it is an african story it is a story of hope resilience and glamour there was hollywood then came today we have the third largest film industry in the world,False,False,good,,,,,,
what we see here is a mother in india and she is speaking which is a newly discovered language and she is talking to her baby what this mother and the people who speak in the world understands is that to preserve this language they need to speak it to the babies and therein lies a critical puzzle why is it that you cant preserve a language by speaking to you and i to the adults well it is got to do with your brain what we see here is that language has a critical period for learning the way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i want you to take a look at this baby what youre drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch but today im going to talk to you about something you cant see what is going on up in that little brain of hers the modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what is going on up there is nothing short of rocket science and what were learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the celestial openness of the child s mind,False,False,good,,,,,,
im a medical illustrator and i come from a slightly different point of view ive been watching since i grew up the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences and while these are both wonderful things in their own right they both have very wonderful things going for them truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date,True,True,good,,,,,,
are really quite amazing and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other they pass information to each other they cause different things to happen inside the cell and the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly from information that is brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes no life from the smallest life to everybody here would be possible without these little micro machines in fact it would really in the absence of these machines have made the attendance here chris really quite sparse,True,True,good,,,,,,
this is the fedex delivery guy of the cell this little guy is called the and he pulls a sack that is full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it is needed in the cell whether it is to a membrane whether it is to an whether it is to build something or repair something and each of us has about of these things running around right now inside each one of your trillion cells so no matter how lazy you feel youre not really intrinsically doing nothing,True,True,good,,,,,,
and you can actually roll some of the pictures now because i dont want to look at me on the screen truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences,False,False,good,,,,,,
truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences they are things that describe beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed if you look at the math squared if you look at the constant where there is an ideal where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe these are things that are really difficult to understand and what ive tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustrator since i was taught animation by my father who was a sculptor and my visual mentor i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation by using pictures by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth and can be taught and can be understood students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them but the way theyre taught is compartmentalized and it is drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident it is almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone we dont want to do that to our students so we have an opportunity to really open up education,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i had a telephone call from robert lue at harvard in the molecular and cellular biology department a couple of years ago he asked me if my team and i would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at harvard so we embarked on a project that would explore the cell that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on they could have a mental image of the cell as a large bustling hugely complicated city that is occupied by micro machines and these micro machines really are at the heart of life these micro machines which are the envy of the world over are self directed powerful precise accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids and these micro machines power how a cell moves,False,False,good,,,,,,
june i landed for the first time in rome italy i wasnt there to sightsee i was there to solve world hunger,True,True,good,,,,,,
that is right i was a old student armed with a prototype tool developed back at my university and i was going to help the world food programme fix hunger so i strode into the headquarters building and my eyes scanned the row of un flags and i smiled as i thought to myself the engineer is here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
tell me the food that youve purchased tell me where it is going and when it needs to be there and im going to tell you the shortest fastest cheapest best set of to take for the food were going to save money were going to avoid delays and disruptions and bottom line were going to save lives youre welcome,True,True,good,,,,,,
i thought it was going to take months ok maybe even this is not quite how it panned out just a couple of months into the project my french boss he told me you know mallory it is a good idea but the data you need for your algorithms is not there it s the right idea but at the wrong time and the right idea at the wrong time is the wrong idea,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now for me what i find exciting about data philanthropy donating data donating decision scientists and donating technology it is what it means for young professionals like me who are choosing to work at companies studies show that the next generation of the workforce care about having their work make a bigger impact we want to make a difference and so through data philanthropy companies can actually help engage and retain their decision scientists and that is a big deal for a profession that is in high demand data philanthropy makes good business sense and it also can help revolutionize the humanitarian world if we coordinated the planning and logistics across all of the major facets of a humanitarian operation we could feed clothe and shelter hundreds of thousands more people and companies need to step up and play the role that i know they can in bringing about this revolution youve probably heard of the saying food for thought well this is literally thought for food it finally is the right idea at the right time,True,False,bad,,,,,,
project over i was crushed when i look back now on that first summer in rome and i see how much has changed over the past six years it is an absolute transformation it is a coming of age for bringing data into the humanitarian world it is exciting it s inspiring,False,False,good,,,,,,
my experiences back in rome prove using data you can save lives ok not that first attempt but eventually we got there let me paint the picture for you imagine that you have to plan breakfast lunch and dinner for people and you only have a certain budget to do it say million dollars per month well what should you do what is the best way to handle it should you buy rice wheat oil how much it sounds simple it is not you have possible foods and you have to pick five of them that s already over different combinations,False,False,good,,,,,,
you have possible foods and you have to pick five of them that is already over different combinations then for each food that you pick you need to decide how much youll buy where youre going to get it from where youre going to store it how long it is going to take to get there you need to look at all of the different transportation as well and that is already over million options if you considered each option for a single second that would take you over years to get through million options so we created a tool that allowed to weed through all million options in just a matter of days it turned out to be incredibly successful,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we created a tool that allowed to weed through all million options in just a matter of days it turned out to be incredibly successful in an operation in iraq we saved percent of the costs and this meant that you had the ability to feed an additional people it is all thanks to the use of data and modeling complex systems but we didnt do it alone the unit that i worked with in rome they were unique they believed in collaboration they brought in the academic world they brought in companies,False,False,good,,,,,,
they believed in collaboration they brought in the academic world they brought in companies and if we really want to make big changes in big problems like world hunger we need everybody to the table we need the data people from humanitarian organizations leading the way and orchestrating just the right types of engagements with academics with governments and there is one group that is not being leveraged in the way that it should be did you guess it panies have a major role to play in fixing the big problems in our world ive been in the private sector for two years now,False,False,good,,,,,,
another time i was devastated because my favorite mobile game bird was being taken off the app store,True,True,good,,,,,,
so i was faced with the dilemma to either never update my phone or never play bird again,True,True,good,,,,,,
unhappy with both options i did the only thing that made sense to me i made a physical version of bird that could never be taken off the app store,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and then more of them got into it and they became more interested in the project so i started looking for more creative ways to introduce technology to students what i found was that most technology kits available in school look a little intimidating theyre all made of plastic parts that you cant customize on top of that theyre all very expensive costing hundreds of dollars per kit so that is certainly not very affordable for most classroom budgets since i didnt find anything i decided to make something on my own i started with paper and fabric after all we all played with those since we were kids and they are also pretty cheap and can be found anywhere around the house,False,False,good,,,,,,
i started with paper and fabric after all we all played with those since we were kids and they are also pretty cheap and can be found anywhere around the house and i a project where students can create a light up creature using fabric and eyes they were all helping each other in classrooms and were laughing and discussing the project and most importantly they were able to insert their own creativity into the project so because of the success of this project i continued to create more engineering projects to challenge my students and i also started to take these workshops outside of school and into the community and something really interesting happened i noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds started coming to our workshops,False,False,good,,,,,,
this statistic might look familiar if you walked into a high school robotics club or a college engineering class now there is a wide variety of problems that contribute to the lack of diversity in the technology force perhaps one solution could be to introduce technology to students through creative projects,False,False,good,,,,,,
i was afraid of womanhood not that im not afraid now but ive learned to pretend ive learned to be flexible in fact ive developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear let me explain back in the and when i was growing up little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy really not quite clear what we were supposed to be,True,True,good,,,,,,
now my mother was different she was a homemaker but she and i didnt go out and do girlie things together and she didnt buy me pink outfits instead she knew what i needed and she bought me a book of cartoons and i just ate it up i drew and i drew and since i knew that humor was acceptable in my family i could draw do what i wanted to do and not have to perform not have to speak i was very shy and i could still get approval i was launched as a cartoonist now when were young we dont always know we know there are rules out there but we dont always know we dont perform them right even though we are imprinted at birth with these things and were told what the most important color in the world is were told what shape were supposed to be in,True,True,good,,,,,,
now the rules that im talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture were being corrected and the primary policemen are women because we are the carriers of the tradition we pass it down from generation to generation not only that we always have this vague notion that something s expected of us and on top of all off these rules they keep changing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
instead she knew what i needed and she bought me a book of cartoons and i just ate it up,False,False,good,,,,,,
i cant help it i live here even though ive traveled a lot i still think like an american woman but i believe that the rules that im talking about are universal of course that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the u s consequently we have women because were on the ground we know the tradition we have amazing antennae,False,False,good,,,,,,
now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists which i so enjoy and it is given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth to get at the issues quickly and succinctly and not only that it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect but through the heart my work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world countries such as saudi arabia iran turkey argentina france and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties and these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances but i feel blessed to be able to work with them and we talk about how women have such strong perceptions because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition keepers that we can have the great potential to be change agents and i think i truly believe that we can change this thing one laugh at a time,False,False,good,,,,,,
but the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical maybe a little bit more scientific maybe a little bit more chef y than they otherwise would have because with that beautiful photo maybe i can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time steaming ought to be faster it turns out it isnt because of something called film condensation and this explains that well that first cutaway picture worked so we said okay let us do some more so here s another one we discovered why are the shape they are this shaped wok doesnt work very well this caught fire three times but we had a philosophy which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second,True,True,good,,,,,,
now you might wonder how do we make these most people assume we use and the answer is no not really we use a machine shop and it turns out the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world,True,True,good,,,,,,
i went to chef school in france and there is a way the world both envisions food the way the world writes about food and learns about food and it is largely what you would find in these books,False,False,good,,,,,,
and there is a way the world both envisions food the way the world writes about food and learns about food and it is largely what you would find in these books and it is a wonderful thing but there is some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established in the last years people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food in fact understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking some of the chemistry some of the physics and so forth but that is not in any of those books there is also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed some about new aesthetics new approaches to food there s a chef in spain named ferran adria,False,False,good,,,,,,
so im going to show you how to create one with a remote now this requires another piece of hardware which is this infrared pen you can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the radio shack it is got a battery a button and an infrared led you guys cant see it but it turns on whenever i push the button now what this means is that if i run this piece of software the camera sees the infrared dot and i can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels and now this is like an interactive surface so for about of hardware you can have your own this is adobe thank you,True,True,good,,,,,,
for the second demo i have this remote that is actually next to the tv so it is pointing away from the display rather than pointing at the display and why this is interesting is that if you put on say a pair of safety glasses that have two infrared dots in them they are going to give the computer an approximation of your head location and why this is interesting is i have this sort of application running on the computer monitor which has a room with some targets floating in it and you can see that it looks like a room kind of like a video game it sort of looks but for the most part the image looks pretty flat and bound to the surface of the screen but if we turn on head tracking the computer can change the image that is on the screen and make it respond to the head movements so let us switch back to that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so as researchers something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities or achieve certain goals and this is essential to the progress of science or exploration of what is possible but it creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology something that motivates me and gets me really excited about my research is when i see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population im going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention that i think embody this philosophy and they actually use the nintendo remote,False,False,good,,,,,,
im going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention that i think embody this philosophy and they actually use the nintendo remote for those of you who arent familiar with this device it is a video game controller and it is mostly advertised for its motion sensing capabilities so you can swing a tennis racket or hit a baseball bat but what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high performing infrared camera and im going to show you two demos of why this is useful so here i have my computer set up with the projector and i have a remote sitting on top of it and for example if youre in a school that doesnt have a lot money probably a lot of schools or if youre in an office environment and you want an interactive normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars so im going to show you how to create one with a remote,False,False,good,,,,,,
i grew up amongst those animals i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called game reserve it is a place where my family has been in the safari business for four generations now for as long as i can remember my job has been to take people out into nature and so i think it is a lovely twist of fate today to have the opportunity to bring some of my experiences out in nature in to this gathering africa is a place where people still sit under starlit skies and around campfires and tell stories and so what i have to share with you today is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories stories about heroes of heart now my stories are not the stories that youll hear on the news and while it is true that africa is a harsh place i also know it to be a place where people animals and ecosystems teach us about a more interconnected world when i was nine years old president mandela came to stay with my family he had just been released from his years of incarceration and was in a period of readjustment to his sudden global icon status members of the african national congress thought that in the bush he would have time to rest and recuperate away from the public eye and it is true that lions tend to be a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi,True,False,bad,,,,,,
mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa peace reconciliation harmony through this act of immense open he was to become the embodiment of what in south africa we call i am because of you or people are not people without other people it is not a new idea or value but it is one that i certainly think at these times is worth building on in fact it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa we get to experience the deepest parts of our own humanity through our interactions with others is at play right now you are holding a space for me to express the deepest truth of who i am without you im just a guy talking to an empty room and i spent a lot of time last week doing that and it is not the same as this,True,True,good,,,,,,
he then moved across into what we called the habitat team these were the people on the reserve who were responsible for its well being he fixed roads he mended wetlands he did some anti poaching and then one day we were out together and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked and it was an old track but for fun he turned and he began to follow it and i tell you i could tell by the speed at which he moved on those pad marks that this man was a ph d tracker if you drove past solly somewhere out on the reserve you look up in your rearview mirror youd see hed stopped the car meters down the road just in case you need help with something the only accusation i ever heard leveled at him was when one of our clients said solly you are pathologically helpful,True,True,good,,,,,,
when i started professionally guiding people out into this environment solly was my tracker we worked together as a team and the first guests we ever got were a philanthropy group from your east coast and they said to solly on the side they said before we even go out to see lions and leopards we want to see where you live so we took them up to his house and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when wife who was learning english was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying hello i love you welcome i love you,True,True,good,,,,,,
now on the day that solly saved my life he was already my hero it was a hot day and we found ourselves down by the river because of the heat i took my shoes off and i rolled up my pants and i walked into the water solly remained on the bank the water was clear running over sand and we turned and we began to make our way upstream and a few meters ahead of us there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank and its branches were touching the water and it was shadowy and if had been a horror movie people in the audience would have started saying dont go in there dont go in there,True,True,good,,,,,,
now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you is the ferocity of the bite wham it hits me by my right leg it pulls me it turns i throw my hand up im able to grab a branch it is shaking me violently it s a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that,True,False,bad,,,,,,
pat im so happy because it was time for him to pass on he was suffering and so of course there is the mixed emotions but i just think of so many occurrences like the time he went on the oprah show and asked her what the show would be about,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i mean that is just incredible humility,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i grew up in wonder i grew up amongst those animals i grew up in the wild eastern part of south africa at a place called game reserve,False,False,good,,,,,,
mandela said often that the gift of prison was the ability to go within and to think to create in himself the things he most wanted for south africa peace reconciliation harmony through this act of immense open he was to become the embodiment of what in south africa we call i am because of you,False,False,good,,,,,,
solly grew up tending to his father s cattle now i can tell you i dont know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle but it makes for resourcefulness the first job that he ever got in the safari business was fixing the safari trucks,False,False,good,,,,,,
he begins to make his way to me the croc again continues to shake me it goes to bite me a second time i notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream as it bites the second time i kick,False,False,good,,,,,,
i notice a slick of blood in the water around me that gets washed downstream as it bites the second time i kick my foot goes down its throat it spits me out i pull myself up into the branches and as i come out of the water i look over my shoulder my leg from the knee down is mangled beyond description the bone is cracked the meat is torn up i make an instant decision that ill never look at that again,False,False,good,,,,,,
the meat is torn up i make an instant decision that ill never look at that again as i come out of the water solly arrives at a deep section a channel between us he knows he sees the state of my leg he knows that between him and i there is a crocodile and i can tell you this man doesnt slow down for one second he comes straight into the channel he wades in to above his waist he gets to me he grabs me im still in a vulnerable position,False,False,good,,,,,,
he grabs me im still in a vulnerable position he picks me and puts me on his shoulder this is the other thing about solly he is strong he turns he walks me up the bank he lays me down he pulls his shirt off he wraps it around my leg picks me up a second time walks me to a vehicle and he is able to get me to medical attention,False,False,good,,,,,,
now now i dont know how many people you know that go into a deep channel of water that they know has a crocodile in it to come and help you but for solly it was as natural as breathing and he is one amazing example of what i have experienced all over africa in a more collective society we realize from the inside that our own well being is deeply tied to the well being of others danger is shared pain is shared,False,False,good,,,,,,
after a few years they had several newspapers in central and eastern europe they were run by an inexperienced staff with no visual culture no budgets for visuals in many places there were not even art directors i decided to be to work for them as an art director before i was an architect and my grandmother asked me once what are you doing for a living i said im designing newspapers what there is nothing to design there it s just boring letters and she was right,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i thought these guys took some creepy run down entertainment and put it to the highest possible level of performance art i thought oh my god maybe i can do the same with these boring newspapers and i did,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what is image got do with it and i must say i think is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages because im going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up but im going to try and do something different and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that weve been talking about so africa is a complex continent full of contradictions as you can see were not the only ones,True,True,good,,,,,,
we cant whine and complain the west is doing this what are we doing where are the rest of the swahili speakers why are we not generating our own content you know it is not enough to complain we need to act reuters now integrates african into their coverage of africa so that is a start and weve heard of all their other initiatives the cheetah generation the aid approach you know is flawed and after all the hoopla of live were still not anywhere in the picture no youre not,True,True,good,,,,,,
you know it is amazing i mean we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent just think about that you know and this is typically what weve been talking about the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff now why is that a problem a typical disaster story disease corruption poverty and some of you might be standing here thinking saying ok you know ory youre harvard educated and all you privileged people come here saying the poor people let us focus on business and the markets and whatever and theyre all there is the percent of africans who really need help and i want to tell you that this is my story ok and it is the story of many of the africans who are here we start with poverty,False,False,good,,,,,,
they adopted a very interesting approach to education which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford so they took me to a private catholic elementary school which set the foundation for what ended up being my career and what happened was because they could afford it sometimes sometimes not i got kicked out pretty much every term you know someone would come in with a list of the people who havent paid school fees and when they started getting pretty strict you had to leave until your school fees could be paid and i remember thinking i mean why dont these guys just take me to a cheap school because you know as a kid youre embarrassed and youre sensitive and everyone knows you guys dont have money but they kept at it and i now understand why they did what they did,False,False,good,,,,,,
i experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be alice in wonderland penn state asked me a communications teacher to teach a communications class for engineering students and i was scared,True,True,good,,,,,,
need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges from energy to environment to health care among others and if we dont know about it and understand it then the work isnt done and i believe it is our responsibility as non scientists to have these interactions but these great conversations cant occur if our scientists and engineers dont invite us in to see their wonderland so scientists and engineers please talk nerdy to us i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging first question to answer for us so what tell us why your science is relevant to us dont just tell me that you study but tell me that you study which is the mesh like structure of our bones because it is important to understanding and treating osteoporosis,False,False,good,,,,,,
africa in the they were sent down to find if there was any opportunity for selling shoes and they wrote telegrams back to manchester and one of them wrote situation hopeless they dont wear shoes and the other one wrote glorious opportunity they dont have any shoes yet,True,True,good,,,,,,
now there is a similar situation in the classical music world because there are some people who think that classical music is dying and there are some of us who think you aint seen nothing yet and rather than go into statistics and trends and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing and the record companies that are folding i thought we should do an experiment tonight actually it is not really an experiment because i know the outcome,True,True,good,,,,,,
before we start i need to do two things one is i want to remind you of what a seven child sounds like when he plays the piano maybe you have this child at home he sounds something like this i see some of you recognize this child now if he practices for a year and takes lessons he is now eight and he sounds like this he practices for another year and takes lessons he is nine then he practices for another year and takes lessons now he s at that point they usually give up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now if youd waited for one more year you would have heard this now what happened was not maybe what you thought which is he suddenly became passionate engaged involved got a new teacher he hit puberty or whatever it is what actually happened was the impulses were reduced you see the first time he was playing with an impulse on every note and the second with an impulse every other note you can see it by looking at my head,True,True,good,,,,,,
the nine put an impulse on every four notes the old on every eight notes and the old one impulse on the whole phrase i dont know how we got into this position,True,True,good,,,,,,
i was working with this young pianist and said the trouble with you is youre a two buttock player you should be a one buttock player i moved his body while he was playing and suddenly the music took off it took flight the audience gasped when they heard the difference then i got a letter from this gentleman he said i was so moved i went back and i transformed my entire company into a one buttock company,True,True,good,,,,,,
there are people i believe my estimation is that probably of you are absolutely passionate about classical music you adore classical music your fm is always on that classical dial you have cds in your car and you go to the symphony your children are playing instruments you cant imagine your life without classical music that is the first group quite small then there is another bigger group the people who dont mind classical music,True,True,good,,,,,,
know youve come home from a long day and you take a glass of wine and you put your feet up a little vivaldi in the background doesnt do any harm that is the second group now comes the third group people who never listen to classical music it is just simply not part of your life you might hear it like second hand smoke at the airport,True,True,good,,,,,,
and maybe a little bit of a march from aida when you come into the hall but otherwise you never hear it that is probably the largest group and then there is a very small group these are the people who think theyre tone deaf amazing number of people think theyre tone deaf actually i hear a lot my husband is tone deaf,True,True,good,,,,,,
it doesnt work for me to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and are passionate about classical music and those who have no relationship to it at all the tone deaf people theyre no longer here but even between those three categories it is too wide a gulf so im not going to go on until every single person in this room downstairs and in aspen and everybody else looking will come to love and understand classical music so that is what were going to do now you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind that this is going to work if you look at my face right it is one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt for one moment the capacity of the people he is leading to realize whatever he is dreaming imagine if martin luther king had said i have a dream of course im not sure theyll be up to it,True,True,good,,,,,,
it can be the other buttock you know a gentleman was once watching a presentation i was doing when i was working with a young pianist he was the president of a corporation in ohio i was working with this young pianist and said the trouble with you is youre a two buttock player,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you were tone deaf you couldnt change the gears on your car in a stick shift car you couldnt tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from rome and the telephone the telephone,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the telephone the telephone if your mother calls on the miserable telephone she calls and says hello you not only know who it is you know what mood she is in you have a fantastic ear everybody has a fantastic ear so nobody is tone deaf but i tell you what it doesnt work for me to go on with this thing with such a wide gulf between those who understand love and are passionate about classical music and those who have no relationship to it at all the tone deaf people theyre no longer here,False,False,good,,,,,,

and she told me this she said we were in the train going to auschwitz and i looked down and saw my brother s shoes were missing i said are you so stupid cant you keep your things together for the way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother unfortunately it was the last thing she ever said to him because she never saw him again he did not survive and so when she came out of auschwitz she made a vow she told me this she said i walked out of auschwitz into life and i made a vow and the vow was i will never say anything that couldnt stand as the last thing i ever say now can we do that no,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what does the learning zone look like take a political leader and the greatest orator and lawyer in ancient greece to become great he didnt spend all his time just being an orator or a lawyer which would be his performance zone but instead he did activities designed for improvement of course he studied a lot he studied law and philosophy with guidance from mentors but he also realized that being a lawyer involved persuading other people so he also studied great speeches and acting to get rid of an odd habit he had of involuntarily lifting his shoulder he practiced his speeches in front of a mirror and he suspended a sword from the ceiling so that if he raised his shoulder it would hurt,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but the people who continue to spend time in the learning zone do continue to always improve the best salespeople at least once a week do activities with the goal of improvement they read to extend their knowledge consult with colleagues or domain experts try out new strategies solicit feedback and reflect the best chess players spend a lot of time not playing games of chess which would be their performance zone but trying to predict the moves grand masters made and analyzing them each of us has probably spent many many many hours typing on a computer without getting faster but if we spent to minutes each day fully concentrating on typing to percent faster than our current reliable speed we would get faster especially if we also identified what mistakes were making and practiced typing those words that is deliberate practice in what other parts of our lives perhaps that we care more about are we working hard but not improving much because were always in the performance zone now this is not to say that the performance zone has no value it very much does when i needed a knee surgery i didnt tell the surgeon poke around in there and focus on what you dont know,True,True,good,,,,,,
trying to do our best at whatever we do whether it is our job family school or anything else i feel that way i try my best but some time ago i came to a realization that i wasnt getting much better at the things i cared most about whether it was being a husband or a friend or a professional or teammate and i wasnt improving much at those things even though i was spending a lot of time working hard at them ive since realized from conversations ive had and from research that this stagnation despite hard work turns out to be pretty common so id like to share with you some insights into why that is and what we can all do about it,False,False,good,,,,,,
so id like to share with you some insights into why that is and what we can all do about it what ive learned is that the most effective people and teams in any domain do something we can all emulate they go through life deliberately alternating between two zones the learning zone and the performance zone the learning zone is when our goal is to improve then we do activities designed for improvement concentrating on what we havent mastered yet which means we have to expect to make mistakes knowing that we will learn from them that is very different from what we do when were in our performance zone which is when our goal is to do something as best as we can to execute then we concentrate on what we have already mastered and we try to minimize mistakes both of these zones should be part of our lives but being clear about when we want to be in each of them with what goal focus and expectations helps us better perform and better improve,False,False,good,,,,,,
there is emotional damage done when young people cant be themselves when they are forced to edit who they are in order to be acceptable it is a kind of violence ultimately im a quintessential success story i attended boarding school and college in new england studied abroad in chile and returned to the bronx to be a middle school teacher i received a truman scholarship a fulbright and a soros fellowship and i could list more,True,False,bad,,,,,,

but there were other novelties as well very quickly i felt like i didnt belong i learned that i didnt speak the right way and to demonstrate the proper ways of speaking my teachers gave me frequent lessons in public on the appropriate way to enunciate certain words a teacher once instructed me in the hallway king she said this loudly dena it is not like youre running around with an axe that s silly,False,False,good,,,,,,
now notice that the leader embraces him as an equal now it is not about the leader anymore it is about them plural now there he is calling to his friends now if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself it takes guts to stand out like that the first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader,True,True,good,,,,,,
but we might have missed the real lesson here the biggest lesson if you noticed did you catch it is that leadership is over glorified yes it was the guy who was first and hell get all the credit but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader so as were told that we should all be leaders that would be really ineffective if you really care about starting a movement have the courage to follow and show others how to follow,False,False,good,,,,,,
as a way when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes and see with your hands because youre not looking at your hands youre looking at where the balls are or youre looking at the audience so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm with the obvious reference to the feet but it is also time where the feet were where the balls were thanks so visual music rhythm and complexity im going to build towards complexity now juggling three balls is simple and normal,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now let us actually learn something actually let me put you in that area of learning which is very insecure you want to do it yeah ok hands out in front of you palms up together what youre going to learn is this,True,True,good,,,,,,
index finger middle finger ring little little ring middle index and then open finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger,True,False,bad,,,,,,
all right a lot of different learning processes going on in here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now i assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer ok so what youre doing is youre going la la la and youre getting this ok so that is exactly what im going to ask you to do but in a slightly different way youre going to combine it so what i want you to do is fingers ill tell you what to do with your fingers same thing but i want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the only other thing is it was a real shock i always drove motorcycles and when i bought my first car it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents house interesting anyway balance constant movement to find an approach to stillness cheating,True,True,good,,,,,,
making up the rules so you cant cheat so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body to have a conversation with it to speak to listen,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now it is dependent on rhythm and keeping a center of balance when it falls going underneath so there is a rhythm to it the rhythm can get much smaller as your skill increases you learn to find those tinier spaces those tinier movements thanks now im going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways and also oh actually if youre bored not here here s one use for it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i started juggling a long time ago but long before that i was a golfer and that is what i was a golfer and as a golfer and as a kid one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores that i sort of lived my whole life is process and it is the process of learning things one of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer but he was lefty and he had a real passion for golf and he also created this whole mythology about ben hogan and various things well i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time but grew to know stuff about,False,False,good,,,,,,
i do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands because a lot of juggling is hand oriented but using the rhythm of my body and feet and controlling the balls with my feet,False,False,good,,,,,,
and so what id like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique so juggling gravity up down,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights but then hopefully even rhythm and you can change the rhythm good michael you can change the rhythm if you get out of the lights ok change the rhythm so it is even or you can go back and change the height now skill but youre boxed in if you can only do it up and down that way so youve got to go after the space down there ok then youve got to combine them because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you,False,False,good,,,,,,
now im actually going to ask you to try something so youve got to pay plexity if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions change it is learning skills like being in a high speed car crash things slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn you may not be able to affect it it almost drifts on you it goes,False,False,good,,,,,,
ok so white ball and finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger pink finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger green finger finger finger finger yellow finger finger finger pink or finger pink finger finger finger finger finger finger finger all right,False,False,good,,,,,,

but working with one ball now what if you attach something to it or change it this is a little thing that i made because i really like the idea of curves and balls together and then creating space and the rhythm of space using the surface of the balls the surface of the arms just a little toy which leads me to the next thing which is what have i got here ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
i love ceramics and all of that it s a combination of that the beauty of that the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents,False,False,good,,,,,,
is something really i dont know what it is yet and that is good i like not to know for as long as possible well because then it tells me the truth instead of me imposing the truth and what it is is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves and what it involves and i dont know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not but ill do a little bit of it it initially started off with me stacking these things bunches of them and then playing with the sense of space of filling in the space and then it started changing and become folding on themselves and then changing levels,False,False,good,,,,,,
and she said oh so is that true for humans too and i thought okay here we go i didnt know it would happen so quick at eight i was trying to remember all the guidebooks and all i could remember was only answer the question theyre asking dont give any more information,True,True,good,,,,,,

tapestries were portable you could roll them up send them ahead of you and in the time it took to hang them up you could transform a cold dank interior into a richly colored setting tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated or even themselves and in addition to that tapestries were hugely expensive they required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials the wools the silks even gold and silver thread so all in all in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda well i became a tapestry historian in due course i ended up as a curator at the metropolitan museum because i saw the met as one of the few places where i could organize really big exhibitions about the subject i cared so passionately about and in about the then director philippe de montebello gave me the go ahead to organize an exhibition for we normally have these very long lead in times,False,False,good,,,,,,
and if you look at this photograph carefully the bottom half of this is rather brown and that glue is hide glue now if youre a conservator you can take off this glue reasonably easily the top half is wood glue it is polyvinyl acetate emulsion that doesnt dissolve in water once it is dry and it is much tougher than the parchment that it was written on and so before we could start imaging archimedes we had to take this book apart so it took four years to take apart and this is a rare action shot ladies and gentlemen,True,True,good,,,,,,
id just come back from living in spain for a while and id joined this fortune company i thought this is fantastic im going to have big impact on the world i had all these ideas and within about two months i noticed at about every morning i had this strange urge to want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer i dont know if anyone s ever felt that and i noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space had already automated my job role and this is right about when i got this sage advice to build up my resume well as im trying to figure out what two story window im going to jump out of and change things up i read some altogether different advice from warren buffett and he said taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age,True,True,good,,,,,,

im going to tell you about why i became a sculptor and you may think that sculptors well they deal with meta they deal with objects they deal with bodies but i think really what i care about most is making space and that is what ive called this talk making space space that exists within us and without us so when i was a child i dont know how many of you grew up in the but i was sent upstairs for an enforced rest,True,True,good,,,,,,
i mean after lunch youre you know youre six and you want to go and climb a tree but i had to go upstairs this tiny little room that was actually made out of an old balcony so it was incredibly hot small and light and i had to lie there it was ridiculous but anyway for some reason i promised myself that i wasnt going to move that i was going to do this thing that mummy wanted me to do and there i was lying there in this tiny space hot dark claustrophobic matchbox sized behind my eyes but it was really weird like after this went on for days weeks months that space would get bigger and darker and cooler until i really looked forward to that half an hour of enforced immobility and rest and i really looked forward to going to that place of darkness do you mind if we do something completely different can we all just close our eyes for a minute now this isnt going to be freaky it isnt some cultic thing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
here we are in a space the subjective collective space of the darkness of the body i think of this as the place of imagination of potential but what are its qualities it is there are no things in it it is it is limitless it is endless okay open your eyes that is the space that i think sculpture which is a bit of a paradox sculpture that is about making material propositions but i think that is the space that sculpture can connect us with so imagine were in the middle of america,False,False,good,,,,,,
but the fact is this is evidence of a living body on other bodies rocks that have been the subject of geological formation erosion the action of time on objects this is a place in a way that i just would like you to in a way look at differently because of this event that has happened in it a human event and in general it just asks us to look again at this world so different from in a way the world that we have been sharing with each other the technological world to look again at the elemental world the elemental world that we all live in is that space that we all visited together the darkness of the body i wanted to start again with that environment the environment of the intimate subjective space that each of us lives in but from the other side of appearance so here is a daily activity of the studio you can see i dont do much,False,False,good,,,,,,
that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house the audience with the performers we add one little detail one piece of architectural excess a special effect lighting we very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts so what we wanted to do was produce this effect this lighting effect which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls and what it entails is the use of resin of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that is used throughout the hall in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light like a belt of light rather than separating like a would separate the audience from performers it connects audience with players and this is a that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full scale and this is a guy from salt lake city this is what they look like out there,True,True,good,,,,,,
aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space architecture is nothing but a special effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses our work is across media the work comes in all shapes and sizes it is small and large this is an ashtray a water glass from urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff,False,False,good,,,,,,
the next thing is most of you if you have a stable home life and what i mean is that you dont travel all the time and always in hotels but most people have what we call a center of gravity and a center of gravity is where you keep these objects and these things dont stay in the center of gravity but over time they gravitate there it is where you expect to find stuff and in fact when youre turning around and youre looking inside the house and youre looking for this stuff this is where you look first right ok so when we did this research we found the absolutely percent guaranteed way to never forget anything ever ever again and that is quite simply to have nothing to remember,True,True,good,,,,,,
it is out there it is not in the lab and it is increasingly in places like india china brazil africa we live on a planet billion people about three billion people by the end of this year will have cellular connectivity and itll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that and i mention this because if we want to design for that future we need to figure out what those people are about and that is kind of where i see what my job is and what our team s job is our research often starts with a very simple question,False,False,good,,,,,,
so today id like to share some works in progress since we are still realizing these works we are largely working within the realm of intuition and mystery still so im going to try and describe some of the experiences that were looking for through each of the works so the first work is called the imperial a viewer sort of walks into the room and catches a glimpse of these panels in a messy composition on the wall within seconds as if the panels have noticed the presence of the viewer they appear to panic and sort of get into a strict symmetry,True,True,good,,,,,,
and we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state this also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions one is the altar tablets of the century and the other is about years ago abstract compositions so im just going to take you to a video to give you a sense of scale the largest panel is about two meters high that is about this much and the smallest one is an so a viewer enters the space and they snap to attention and after a while if the viewer continues to remain in the space the panels will sort of become immune to the presence of the viewer and become lax and autonomous again until they sort of sense a presence in the room or a movement when they will again snap to attention,True,True,good,,,,,,
the next work is decoy this is a cardboard model so the object is about as tall as i am it has a rounded body two arms and a very tall head like antenna and its sole purpose is to attract attention towards itself so when a viewer passes by it sort of tilts from side to side and moves its arms more and more frantically as the person gets closer so here is the first test scenario you see the two movements integrated and the object seems to be employing its entire being in this expression of desperation but the idea is that once it is got the person s attention it is no longer interested and it looks for the next person whose attention to get,True,True,good,,,,,,
so in contrast to this very tight grid we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick like quality as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path so we like the idea of these figures sort of skipping along like theyre oblivious and carefree and happy and content until they sort of sense a movement from the viewer and they will hide behind the fastest wall so to us this work also presents its own contradiction these figures are sort of entrapped within this very strong grid which is like a prison but also a fortress because it allows them to be oblivious and naive and carefree and quite oblivious of the external world so all these real life qualities that i talk about are sort of translated to a very specific technical configuration and we were very lucky to collaborate with zurich to develop the first prototype so you see they extracted the motion from our animations and created a wiggle that integrated the head bobbing movement and the back movement so it is really quite small you can see it can fit into the palm of my hand so imagine our excitement when we saw it really working in the studio and here it is,True,False,bad,,,,,,
one is total chaos the other is absolute order and we were interested in seeing how little change it takes to move from one state to the other state this also reminded us of two very different pictorial traditions one is the altar tablets of the century and the other is about years ago abstract compositions so im just going to take you to a video,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this brings me to a quieter small work called handheld the viewer sees a piece of paper that is mounted on the far end of the wall but when you go closer you see that it is a blank or a letter sized piece of paper that is held on either side by two small hands that appear to be carved with a great deal of attention and care from a small block of wood the viewer also sees that this entire sculpture is sort of moving very slightly as if these two hands are trying to hold the paper very still for a long period of time and somehow are not managing to so this instability in the movement very closely resembles the unsteady nature of images seen through a handheld camera so here im going to show you two tandem clips one is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera,False,False,good,,,,,,
so here im going to show you two tandem clips one is through a still camera and the other is through a handheld camera and you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view so weve just removed the camera and transferred that movement onto the panel so here s a video you have to imagine the other hand it is not there yet but to us were sort of trying to evoke a self effacing gesture as if there is a little person with outstretched arms behind this enormous piece of paper that sort of likens it to the amount of strain to be at the service of the observer and present this piece of paper very delicately to the viewer in front of them,False,False,good,,,,,,
it appears to be mass manufactured like it came out of a factory like vacuum cleaners and washing machines because we are always working from a very personal space we like how this consumer aesthetic sort of the object and gives us a bit of distance in its appearance at least and so to us this is a kind of sinister being which is trying to distract you from the things that actually need your attention but it could also be a figure that needs a lot of help the next work is an object that is also a kind of sound instrument in the shape of an amphitheater that is scaled to the size of an audience as perceived from somebody from the stage so from where im standing each of you appears to be this big and the audience sort of takes the entire field of my vision,False,False,good,,,,,,
but that just created another problem now that youve got a malaria resistant mosquito how do you get it to replace all the malaria carrying mosquitos there are a couple options but plan a was basically to breed up a bunch of the new genetically engineered mosquitos release them into the wild and hope that they pass on their genes the problem was that youd have to release literally times the number of native mosquitos to work so in a village with mosquitos you release an extra as you might guess this was not a very popular strategy with the villagers,True,True,good,,,,,,
that is because of gene flow which is a fancy way of saying that neighboring species sometimes if that happens it is possible a gene drive could cross over like asian carp could infect some other kind of carp that is not so bad if your drive just promotes a trait like eye color in fact there is a decent chance that well see a wave of very weird fruit flies in the near future but it could be a disaster if your drive is to eliminate the species entirely the last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this to genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive is something that basically any lab in the world can do an undergraduate can do it a talented high schooler with some equipment can do it now im guessing that this sounds terrifying,True,True,good,,,,,,
interestingly though nearly every scientist i talk to seemed to think that gene drives were not actually that frightening or dangerous partly because they believe that scientists will be very cautious and responsible about using them,True,False,bad,,,,,,
then last january anthony james got an email from a biologist named ethan bier bier said that he and his grad student valentino gantz had stumbled on a tool that could not only guarantee that a particular genetic trait would be inherited but that it would spread incredibly quickly if they were right it would basically solve the problem that he and james had been working on for years as a test they engineered two mosquitos to carry the anti malaria gene and also this new tool a gene drive which ill explain in a minute finally they set it up so that any mosquitos that had inherited the anti malaria gene wouldnt have the usual white eyes but would instead have red eyes that was pretty much just for convenience so they could tell just at a glance which was which,False,False,good,,,,,,
so they took their two anti malarial red eyed mosquitos and put them in a box with ordinary white eyed ones and let them breed in two generations those had produced grandchildren that is not the surprising part this is the surprising part given that you started with just two red eyed mosquitos and white eyed ones you expect mostly white eyed descendants instead when james opened the box all mosquitos had red eyes when i asked ethan bier about this moment he became so excited that he was literally shouting into the phone that s because getting only red eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology genetics,False,False,good,,,,,,
i asked ethan bier about this moment he became so excited that he was literally shouting into the phone that is because getting only red eyed mosquitos violates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology genetics ill keep this quick but genetics says when a male and a female mate their baby inherits half of its from each parent so if our original mosquito was and our new mosquito is ab where b is the anti malarial gene the babies should come out in four permutations ab instead with the new gene drive they all came out ab biologically that shouldnt even be possible so what happened the first thing that happened was the arrival of a gene editing tool known as in many of you have probably heard about so ill just say briefly that is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely easily and quickly,False,False,good,,,,,,
so im going to give you an example of this and take you to a special time in earth s past about million years ago there was a really abrupt warming event and what happened was a whole bunch of carbon dioxide was released into earth s atmosphere and it caused a rapid and pretty extreme global warming event and when i say warm i mean pretty warm that there were things like crocodiles and palm trees as far north as canada and as far south as patagonia so this was a pretty warm time and it happened really abruptly so what we can do is we can go back and find rocks that were deposited at this time and reconstruct how the landscape changed in response to this warming event so here yay rocks,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it is powerful it is dynamic it is constantly changing it is a pretty exciting place to live but i want to share with you guys today my perspective as a geologist in how understanding earth s past can help inform and guide decisions that we make today about how to live on earth s surface,False,False,good,,,,,,
sadly the frequent overuse of the word awesome has now replaced words like great and thank you so webster s dictionary defines the word awesome as fear mingled with admiration or reverence a feeling produced by something majestic now with that in mind was your sandwich awesome how about that parking space was that awesome or that game the other day was that awesome the answer is no no and no a sandwich can be delicious that parking space can be nearby and that game can be a blowout but not everything can be awesome,True,True,good,,,,,,
so when you use the word awesome to describe the most mundane of things youre taking away the very power of the word this author says snowy days or finding money in your pants is awesome,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the grand e on it is almost million years old is the grand canyon awesome yes the grand canyon is louis invented photography in and earlier today when you whipped out your and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich and you know who you are wasnt that easier than exposing the image to copper plates coated with silver i mean come on,True,True,good,,,,,,
did you eat food today did you eat then you can thank the honeybee that is the one because if crops arent pollinated we cant grow food and then were all going to die it is just like that but it is not like a flower can just get up and have sex with another flower although that would be awesome,True,True,good,,,,,,
imagine if you will having to everything on your back wouldnt this be easier for me if i could roll this home yes so i think ill invent the wheel the wheel ladies and gentlemen is the wheel awesome say it with me yes the wheel is awesome the great pyramids were the tallest man made structure in the world for years pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone,False,False,good,,,,,,
fold ok wet hands shake one two three four five six seven eight nine why twelve apostles twelve tribes twelve zodiac signs twelve months the one i like the best it is the biggest number with one syllable,True,True,good,,,,,,
shake fold cuts itself fold the fold is important because it allows suspension you dont have to remember that part but trust me,True,True,good,,,,,,
now let us all say it together shake fold you will for the rest of your life remember those words every time you pick up a paper towel and remember one towel per person for one year pounds of paper no small thing and next year toilet paper,True,False,bad,,,,,,
seventy one million two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels are used by americans every year if we could correction wrong figure billion used every year if we could reduce the usage of paper towels one paper towel per person per day pounds of paper not used we can do that now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers there s the tri fold,False,False,good,,,,,,
now there are all kinds of paper towel dispensers there is the tri fold people typically take two or three there is the one that cuts it that you have to tear off people go one two three four tear this much right there is the one that cuts itself people go one two three four or there is the same thing but recycled paper you have to get five of those because theyre not as absorbent of course,False,False,good,,,,,,
now there is now a real fancy invention it is the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out it is way too big a towel let me tell you a secret if youre really quick if youre really quick and i can prove this this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building how as soon as it starts you just tear it off,False,False,good,,,,,,
most fascinating poll ive seen in my life we asked people do you want this action and to have buildings painted like that and then the second question was do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue to the first question percent of people said yes we like it thirty seven said no we dont like it but to the second question half of them that didnt like it they wanted it to continue,True,False,bad,,,,,,
in my previous life i was an artist i still paint i love art i love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities and i try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics and i see part of my job today the reason for being here not just to campaign for my party but for politics and the role it can play for the better in our lives for years i was mayor of tirana our capital we faced many challenges,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we published before knowing that because we figured it was so beautiful it is gotta be right the experiments had to be wrong and they were now our friend over there albert einstein used to pay very little attention when people said you know there is a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity miller what about that and he would say aw thatll go away,True,True,good,,,,,,
theyre really there newton certainly believed that and he said here it is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws the basic law let us say here s an assumption the assumption is that the basic law really takes the form of a unified theory of all the particles now some people call that a theory of everything that is wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical and i wont go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it is like and so on youve heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway,True,False,bad,,,,,,
maxwell s equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space doesnt matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle it doesnt leave the doesnt change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism there is a new notation in the century that expressed this and if you use that notation the equations get a lot simpler then einstein with his special theory of relativity looked at a whole set of of maxwell s equations which are called special relativity and those then make the equations even shorter and even prettier therefore let us look you dont have to know what these things mean doesnt make any difference but you can just look at the form,True,True,good,,,,,,
the last two the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields the next second equation says that there is no magnetism other than that the only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents someday we may find some slight hole in that argument but for the moment that is the case now here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of they should have heard of it but it is a little tricky to explain in technical detail so i wont do it ill just mention it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it is a property of gravitation it is not something in the human mind the human mind can of course appreciate it and enjoy it use it but it is not it doesnt stem from the human mind it stems from the character of gravity and that is true of all the things were talking about they are properties of the fundamental law the fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin i say here that newton did a lot of things that year gravity the laws of motion the calculus white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow and he could have written quite an essay on what i did over my summer vacation,True,True,good,,,,,,
life can emerge from physics and chemistry plus a lot of accidents the human mind can arise from and a lot of accidents the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents it doesnt diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things plus accidents that is a general rule and it is critically important to realize that you dont need something more in order to get something more people keep asking that when they read my book the quark and the jaguar and they say isnt there something more beyond what you have there presumably they mean something supernatural anyway there isnt,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but im going see what happens if i press this button sure enough ok,False,False,good,,,,,,
im a theorist but im going see what happens if i press this button sure enough ok i used to work in this field of elementary particles what happens to matter if you chop it up very fine what is it made of and the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe and theyre very much connected with the history of the universe we know a lot about four forces there must be a lot more but those are at very very small distances and we havent really interacted with them very much yet the main thing i want to talk about is this that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory,False,False,good,,,,,,
now yeah what do we mean by beautiful that is one thing ill try to make that clear partially clear why should it work and is this something to do with human beings ill let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer and that is it has nothing to do with human beings somewhere in some other planet orbiting some very distant star maybe in a another galaxy there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are and are interested in science it is not impossible i think there probably are lots very likely none is close enough to interact with us but they could be out there very easily and suppose they have you know very different sensory apparatus and so on they have seven tentacles and they have little funny looking compound eyes and a brain shaped like a pretzel,False,False,good,,,,,,
but they could be out there very easily and suppose they have you know very different sensory apparatus and so on they have seven tentacles and they have little funny looking compound eyes and a brain shaped like a pretzel would they really have different laws there are lots of people who believe that and i think it is utter baloney i think there are laws out there and we of course dont understand them at any given time very well but we try and we try to get closer and closer and someday we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces what i call the fundamental law we may not even be terribly far from it but even if we dont run across it in our lifetimes we can still think there is one out there and were just trying to get closer and closer to it,False,False,good,,,,,,
we may not even be terribly far from it but even if we dont run across it in our lifetimes we can still think there is one out there and were just trying to get closer and closer to it i think that is the main point to be made we express these things mathematically and when the mathematics is very simple when in terms of some mathematical notation you can write the theory in a very brief space without a lot of complication that is essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance here s what i was saying about the laws theyre really there newton certainly believed that and he said here it is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws,False,False,good,,,,,,
but other times theyre not and you have only probabilities for different outcomes so what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law it s the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents or chance outcomes that are there in addition,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the fundamental theory doesnt include those chance outcomes they are in addition so it is not a theory of everything and in fact a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents and not just from the fundamental laws now it is often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies and then higher energies and then higher energies or short distances and then shorter distances and then still shorter distances and so on is like peeling the skin of an onion and we keep doing that and build more powerful machines for particles we look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law now what happens is that as we do that as we peel these skins of the onion and we get closer and closer to the underlying law we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one and with the next one,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i want to start by offering you a free no tech life hack and all it requires of you is this that you change your posture for two minutes but before i give it away i want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what youre doing with your body so how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller maybe youre crossing your legs maybe wrapping your ankles sometimes we hold onto our arms like this sometimes we spread out,True,False,bad,,,,,,
were going to come back to that in a few minutes and im hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit it could significantly change the way your life unfolds so were really fascinated with body language and were particularly interested in other people s body language you know were interested in like you know an awkward interaction or a smile or a contemptuous glance or maybe a very awkward wink or maybe even something like a handshake,True,False,bad,,,,,,
what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance well this is what they are so in the animal kingdom they are about expanding so you make yourself big you stretch out you take up space youre basically opening up it is about opening up and this is true across the animal kingdom it is not just limited to primates and humans do the same thing,True,True,good,,,,,,
was like yes you are you are supposed to be here and tomorrow youre going to fake it youre going to make yourself powerful and you know and youre going to go into the classroom and you are going to give the best comment ever you know and she gave the best comment ever and people turned around and were like oh my god i didnt even notice her sitting there,True,False,bad,,,,,,
before you go into the next stressful situation for two minutes try doing this in the elevator in a bathroom stall at your desk behind closed doors that is what you want to do configure your brain to cope the best in that situation get your testosterone up get your down dont leave that situation feeling like oh i didnt show them who i am leave that situation feeling like i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am so i want to ask you first you know both to try power posing and also i want to ask you to share the science because this is simple i dont have ego involved in this,True,True,good,,,,,,
this expression which is known as pride jessica tracy has studied she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are blind do this when they win at a physical competition so when they cross the finish line and theyve won it doesnt matter if theyve never seen anyone do it they do this so the arms up in the v the chin is slightly lifted,False,False,good,,,,,,
what do we do when we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite we close up we wrap ourselves up we make ourselves small we dont want to bump into the person next to us so again both animals and humans do the same thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
this behavior in the classroom and what do i notice i notice that students really exhibit the full range of power so you have people who are like caricatures of really coming into the room they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts like they really want to occupy space when they sit down theyre sort of spread out they raise their hands like this you have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in as soon they come in you see it you see it on their faces and their bodies and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny and they go like this when they raise their hand i notice a couple of things about this,False,False,good,,,,,,
a couple of years later so i get really excited about these things about a couple of years later there was a old she was from canada her father had gone out in the wintertime he was working night shift and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper and they found her hours later frozen lifeless and they brought her back to life there was a old woman in duluth minnesota last year that was found frozen and without a pulse in her front yard one morning in the winter and they brought her back to life the next day she was doing so well they wanted to run tests on her she got cranky and just went home,True,True,good,,,,,,
the researchers had to suit up just to enter it it is filled with this toxic gas hydrogen sulfide now hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us we make it ourselves the highest concentration is in our brains yet it was used as a chemical warfare agent in world war i it is an extraordinarily toxic thing in fact in chemical accidents hydrogen sulfide is known to if you breathe too much of it you collapse to the ground you appear dead but if you were brought out into room air you can be without harm if they do that quickly so i thought wow i have to get some of this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
one model of heart attack animals given hydrogen sulfide showed a percent reduction in heart damage compared to those who got the standard of care that you and i would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today same is true for organ failure when you have loss of function owing to poor of kidney of liver acute respiratory distress syndrome and damage suffered in cardiac bypass surgery so these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine all over the world saying this is true so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide decreases damage that you receive from being exposed to otherwise lethal low oxygen and i should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide required to get this benefit are low incredibly low in fact so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim the metabolism of people much at all to see the benefit i just mentioned which is a wonderful thing if youre thinking about adopting this you dont want to be people out just to save them it is really confusing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so what do i mean when i say suspended animation it is the process by which animals de animate appear dead and then can wake up again without being harmed ok so here is the sort of big idea if you look out at nature you find that as you tend to see suspended animation you tend to see immortality and so what im going to tell you about is a way to tell a person who is in trauma find a way to de animate them a bit so theyre a little more immortal when they have that heart attack an example of an organism or two that happens to be quite immortal would be plant seeds or bacterial spores these creatures are some of the most immortal life forms on our planet and they tend to spend most of their time in suspended animation bacterial spores are thought now by scientists to exist as individual cells that are alive but in suspended animation for as long as million years to suggest that this all sort of about little tiny creatures i want to bring it close to home in the immortal germ line of human beings that is the eggs that sit in the ovaries they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation for up to years in the life of each woman,False,False,good,,,,,,
so then there is also my favorite example of suspended animation this is sea monkeys those of you with children you know about them you go to the pet store or the toy store and you can buy these things you just open the bag and you just dump them into the plastic aquarium and in about a week or so youll have little swimming around well i wasnt so interested in the swimming i was interested in what was going on in the bag the bag on the toy store shelf where those shrimp sat in suspended animation indefinitely,False,False,good,,,,,,
so these are miracles right these are truly miraculous things that happen doctors have a saying that in fact youre not dead until youre warm and dead and it is true it is true in the new england journal of medicine there was a study published that showed that with appropriate people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is beautiful there i was studying these corals for my and after days and days of diving on the same reef i had gotten to know them as individuals i had made friends with coral colonies totally a normal thing to do then hurricane omar smashed them apart and ripped off their skin leaving little bits of wounded tissue that would have a hard time healing and big patches of dead skeleton that would get overgrown by algae when i saw this damage for the first time stretching all the way down the reef i sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear and i cried if a coral could die that fast how could a reef ever survive and why was i making it my job to try to fight for them i never heard another scientist tell that kind of story until last year a scientist in guam wrote i cried right into my mask seeing the damage on the reefs then a scientist in australia wrote i showed my students the results of our coral surveys and we wept crying about corals is having a moment guys,True,True,good,,,,,,
and that is because reefs in the pacific are losing corals faster than weve ever seen before because of climate change the water is so hot for so long in the summers that these animals cant function normally theyre spitting out the colored algae that lives in their skin and the clear bleached tissue that is left usually to death and then rots away then the skeletons are overgrown by algae this is happening over an unbelievable scale the northern great barrier reef lost two thirds of its corals last year over a distance of hundreds of miles then bleached again this year and the bleaching stretched further south,False,False,good,,,,,,
couple theyre sharing a moment together and weve even done an experiment where you can cut out different pieces of this frame and you can still see that theyre sharing it theyre sharing it sort of in parallel now the elements of the scene also communicate this to us but you can read it straight off their faces and if you compare their faces to normal faces it would be a very subtle cue here s another couple he is projecting out at us and she is clearly projecting you know love and admiration at him here s another couple,True,False,bad,,,,,,
other people everyone is interested in other people everyone has relationships with other people and theyre interested in these relationships for a variety of reasons good relationships bad relationships annoying relationships agnostic relationships and what im going to do is focus on the central piece of an interaction that goes on in a relationship so im going to take as inspiration the fact that were all interested in interacting with other people im going to completely strip it of all its complicating features and im going to turn that object that simplified object into a scientific probe and provide the early stages embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact but before i do that let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible,False,False,good,,,,,,
at mit at mit you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain so we are creating dylan which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive and autonomously discovering what are the objects in this visual input so dont worry about the of dylan here im just going to talk about how we test dylan the way we test dylan is by giving it inputs as i said of the same kind that a baby or a child in project prakash would get but for a long time we couldnt quite figure out wow can we get these kinds of video inputs so i thought could we have darius serve as our carrier and that way get the inputs that we feed into dylan so that is what we did,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if you are a blind child in india you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news the first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none and that is because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults and there are very very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children in fact if you were to be treated you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from illustrates this is a three orphan girl who had cataracts so her caretakers took her to the village medicine man and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital the person decided to burn her abdomen with red hot iron bars to drive out the demons the second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age that even if you have your eye corrected the chances of your brain learning how to see are very very slim again slim or none,False,False,good,,,,,,
so ive known a lot of fish in my life ive loved only two that first one it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish flavorful textured meaty a bestseller on the menu what a fish,True,True,good,,,,,,
so the next day just before the event i called don i said don what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said he didnt know he would ask around well i got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let s call him don too,True,False,bad,,,,,,

this second fish it is a different kind of love story it is the romantic kind the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the chef had overcooked it like twice over amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it is been overcooked i cant but this guy can let s call him miguel actually his name is miguel,True,True,good,,,,,,
okay so let us review a farm that doesnt feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldnt even be there in the first place they brood in a town miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests every morning they fly miles into the farm and every evening they fly miles back,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i was imagining a march of the penguins thing so i looked at miguel i said miguel do they fly miles to the farm and then do they fly miles back at night do they do that for the children he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song,True,True,good,,,,,,
and then i realized when he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the river it is a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water is cleaner than when it entered the system is so healthy it the water so not just a farm that doesnt feed its animals not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators but a farm that is literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic a drop in the ocean i know but ill take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it is a recipe for the future of good food whether were talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good,True,False,bad,,,,,,
for the past years weve been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests it is hard to overstate the destruction ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the the salmons swordfish theyve collapsed there is almost nothing left so for better or for worse aquaculture fish farming is going to be a part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and theyre inefficient take tuna a major drawback it s got a feed conversion ratio of to one,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it is at the tip of the river until the the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands they did it by draining the land,False,False,good,,,,,,
said fish i didnt know anything about fish im an expert in relationships and then he is off launching into more talk about rare birds and and strange aquatic plants and dont get me wrong that was really fascinating you know the community unplugged kind of thing it is great but i was in love and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before,False,False,good,,,,,,
well he goes on to tell me it is such a rich system that the fish are eating what theyd be eating in the wild the plant biomass the phytoplankton the it is what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it is totally self renewing there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesnt feed its animals later that day i was driving around this property with miguel and i asked him i said for a place that seems so natural unlike like any farm id ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it was as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see,False,False,good,,,,,,
we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flamingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pinker the belly the better the system okay so let us review a farm that doesnt feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators,False,False,good,,,,,,
i didnt mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and i dont like fish skin i dont like it seared i dont like it crispy it is that acrid tar like flavor i almost never cook with it yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like fish skin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean i mentioned that to miguel and he nodded,False,False,good,,,,,,
i mentioned that to miguel and he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it is the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved to soak up impurities and then he added but our water has no impurities ok a farm that doesnt feed its fish a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators and then i realized when he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the river it s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff,False,False,good,,,,,,
can i be honest i dont love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world one billion people will go hungry today one billion that is more than ever before because of gross inequalities in distribution not tonnage now i dont love this question because it is determined the logic of our food system for the last years feed grain to pesticides to chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked if were feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be that is been the motivation it is been the justification it is been the business plan of american agriculture we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that is quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible,False,False,good,,,,,,
i said im just thinking about it a little bit,True,False,bad,,,,,,
she said youre like the worst vulnerability role model ever,True,True,good,,,,,,
i had no contingency plan for four million,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now let me ask you this question this past week at ted how many of you when you saw vulnerability up here thought it was pure courage vulnerability is not weakness i define vulnerability as emotional risk exposure uncertainty it fuels our daily lives and ive come to the belief this is my year doing this research that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage to be vulnerable to let ourselves be seen to be honest one of the weird things that is happened is after the ted explosion i got a lot of offers to speak all over the country everyone from schools and parent meetings to fortune companies and so many of the calls went like this dr brown we loved your ted talk wed like you to come in and speak wed appreciate it if you wouldnt mention vulnerability or shame,True,True,good,,,,,,
what would you like for me to talk about there is three big answers this is mostly to be honest with you from the business sector innovation creativity and change,True,False,bad,,,,,,
im a fifth generation texan our family motto is lock and load i am not a natural vulnerability researcher so im like just keep walking she is on my six,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i sat down and she said god you look like hell,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that myth is profoundly dangerous,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is what this conference to me is about life is about daring greatly about being in the arena when you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door and you think im going in and im going to try this shame is the gremlin who says uh uh youre not good enough you never finished that your wife left you i know your dad really wasnt in luxembourg he was in sing sing i know those things that happened to you growing up i know you dont think that youre pretty smart talented or powerful enough,False,False,good,,,,,,
your wife left you i know your dad really wasnt in luxembourg he was in sing sing i know those things that happened to you growing up i know you dont think that youre pretty smart talented or powerful enough i know your dad never paid attention even when you made shame is that thing and if we can quiet it down and walk in and say im going to do this we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing percent of the time is who us shame drives two big tapes never good enough and if you can talk it out of that one who do you think you are the thing to understand about shame is it is not guilt shame is a focus on self guilt is a focus on behavior,False,False,good,,,,,,
i made a mistake how many of you would be willing to say that guilt im sorry i made a mistake shame im sorry i am a mistake there is a huge difference between shame and guilt and here s what you need to know shame is highly highly correlated with addiction depression violence aggression bullying suicide eating disorders and here s what you even need to know more guilt inversely correlated with those things,False,False,good,,,,,,
and here s what you even need to know more guilt inversely correlated with those things the ability to hold something weve done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive it is uncomfortable but it is adaptive the other thing you need to know about shame is it is absolutely organized by gender if shame washes over me and washes over chris it is going to feel the same everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame were pretty sure that the only people who dont experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy which means yes i have a little shame no im a sociopath,False,False,good,,,,,,
and so ill leave you with this thought,False,False,good,,,,,,
and so ill leave you with this thought if were going to find our way back to each other vulnerability is going to be that path and i know it is seductive to stand outside the arena because i think i did it my whole life and think to myself im going to go in there and kick some ass when im bulletproof and when im perfect and that is seductive but the truth is that never happens and even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there that is not what we want to see we want you to go in we want to be with you and across from you,False,False,good,,,,,,
okay some bad news first people who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a percent increased risk of dying but that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health,True,False,bad,,,,,,
people who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die in fact they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study including people who had relatively little stress now the researchers estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths americans died prematurely not from stress but from the belief that stress is bad for you,True,True,good,,,,,,
that is over deaths a year now if that estimate is correct that would make believing stress is bad for you the largest cause of death in the united states last year killing more people than skin cancer and homicide,True,True,good,,,,,,
so this study got me wondering can changing how you think about stress make you healthier and here the science says yes when you change your mind about stress you can change your body s response to stress now to explain how this works i want you all to pretend that you are participants in a study designed to stress you out it is called the social stress test you come into the laboratory and youre told you have to give a five minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert sitting right in front of you and to make sure you feel the pressure there are bright lights and a camera in your face kind of like this,True,True,good,,,,,,
and the have been trained to give you discouraging non verbal feedback like this,True,True,good,,,,,,
now that youre sufficiently demoralized time for part two a math test and unbeknownst to you the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it now were going to all do this together it is going to be fun for me okay,True,False,bad,,,,,,
go faster faster please youre going too slow that guy made a mistake we are going to have to start all over again,True,False,bad,,,,,,
has experienced a lot of stress yeah me too but that is not my confession my confession is this i am a health psychologist and my mission is to help people be happier and healthier but i fear that something ive been teaching for the last years is doing more harm than good and it has to do with stress for years ive been telling people stress makes you sick it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease,False,False,good,,,,,,
but what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized was preparing you to meet this challenge now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at harvard university before they went through the social stress test they were taught to rethink their stress response as helpful that pounding heart is preparing you for action if youre breathing faster it is no problem it is getting more oxygen to your brain and participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful for their performance well they were less stressed out less anxious more confident but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical stress response changed now in a typical stress response your heart rate goes up and your blood vessels constrict like this,False,False,good,,,,,,
now in a typical stress response your heart rate goes up and your blood vessels constrict like this and this is one of the reasons that chronic stress is sometimes associated with cardiovascular disease it is not really healthy to be in this state all the time but in the study when participants viewed their stress response as helpful their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this their heart was still pounding but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile it actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage over a lifetime of stressful experiences this one biological change could be the difference between a stress induced heart attack at age and living well into your and this is really what the new science of stress reveals that how you think about stress matters,False,False,good,,,,,,
so my goal as a health psychologist has changed i no longer want to get rid of your stress i want to make you better at stress and we just did a little intervention if you raised your hand and said youd had a lot of stress in the last year we could have saved your life because hopefully the next time your heart is pounding from stress youre going to remember this talk and youre going to think to yourself this is my body helping me rise to this challenge and when you view stress in that way your body believes you and your stress response becomes healthier now i said i have over a decade of demonizing stress to redeem myself from so we are going to do one more intervention,False,False,good,,,,,,
to understand this side of stress we need to talk about a hormone oxytocin and i know oxytocin has already gotten as much hype as a hormone can get it even has its own cute nickname the cuddle hormone because it is released when you hug someone but this is a very small part of what oxytocin is involved in oxytocin is a neuro hormone it fine tunes your brain s social instincts it primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships,False,False,good,,,,,,
it enhances your empathy it even makes you more willing to help and support the people you care about some people have even suggested we should snort oxytocin to become more compassionate and caring but here s what most people dont understand about oxytocin it is a stress hormone your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think i was supposed to talk about my new book which is called blink and it is about snap judgments and first impressions and it comes out in january and i hope you all buy it in triplicate,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that although my new book makes me happy and i think would make my mother happy it is not really about happiness so i decided instead i would talk about someone who i think has done as much to make americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last years a man who is a great personal hero of mine someone by the name of howard moskowitz who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce howard s about this high and he is round and he is in his and he has big huge glasses and thinning gray hair and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality and he has a parrot and he loves the opera and he is a great aficionado of medieval history and by profession he is a now i should tell you that i have no idea what is although at some point in my life i dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in which should tell you something about that relationship,True,True,good,,,,,,
this was an enormous revelation this was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science howard immediately went on the road and he would go to conferences around the country and he would stand up and say you had been looking for the perfect pepsi youre wrong you should be looking for the perfect and people would look at him blankly and say what are you talking about craziness and they would say move next tried to get business nobody would hire him he was obsessed though and he talked about it and talked about it howard loves the yiddish expression to a worm in horseradish the world is horseradish this was his horseradish,True,True,good,,,,,,
in fact they would do the famous bowl test back in the with rag and prego youd have a plate of spaghetti and you would pour it on right and the rag would all go to the bottom and the prego would sit on top that is called adherence and anyway despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence and the quality of their tomato paste prego was struggling so they came to howard and they said fix us and howard looked at their product line and he said what you have is a dead tomato society so he said this is what i want to do and he got together with the campbell s soup kitchen and he made varieties of spaghetti sauce and he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce by sweetness by level of garlic by ness by tartness by by visible solids my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business,True,False,bad,,,,,,
ill explain to you why what howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat what will make people happy is to ask them and for years and years and years rag and prego would have focus groups and they would sit you down and they would say what do you want in a spaghetti sauce tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce and for all those years years through all those focus group sessions no one ever said they wanted extra chunky even though at least a third of them deep in their hearts actually did,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want deep down if i asked all of you for example in this room what you want in a coffee you know what youd say every one of you would say i want a dark rich hearty roast it is what people always say when you ask them what do you like dark rich hearty roast what percentage of you actually like a dark rich hearty roast according to howard somewhere between and percent of you most of you like milky weak coffee,True,True,good,,,,,,
and instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight ounce bottle the way that french s and did they decided to charge four dollars and they had those ads with the guy in the rolls royce eating the grey another pulls up and says do you have any grey and the whole thing after they did that grey takes off takes over the mustard business and everyone s take home lesson from that was that the way to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive something to aspire to it s to make them turn their back on what they think they like now and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy,True,True,good,,,,,,
better mustard a more expensive mustard a mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning and howard looked to that and said that is wrong mustard does not exist on a hierarchy mustard exists just like tomato sauce on a horizontal plane there is no good mustard or bad mustard there is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard there are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people he fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste and for that as well we owe howard moskowitz a huge vote of thanks third thing that howard did and perhaps the most important is howard confronted the notion of the platonic dish,True,True,good,,,,,,
and one of his first clients was pepsi this is many years ago back in the early and pepsi came to howard and they said you know there is this new thing called aspartame and we would like to make diet pepsi,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is all over the place now most people in that business in the world of testing food and such are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess they think well you know figuring out what people think about cola s not that easy,False,False,good,,,,,,
and finally he had a breakthrough vlasic pickles came to him and they said doctor moskowitz we want to make the perfect pickle and he said there is no perfect pickle there are only perfect pickles and he came back to them and he said you dont just need to improve your regular you need to create and that is where we got pickles,False,False,good,,,,,,
and he brought in people by the truckload into big halls and he sat them down for two hours and over the course of that two hours he gave them ten bowls ten small bowls of pasta with a different spaghetti sauce on each one,False,False,good,,,,,,
the end of that process after doing it for months and months he had a mountain of data about how the american people feel about spaghetti sauce and then he analyzed the data did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce no howard doesnt believe that there is such a thing instead he looked at the data and he said let us see if we can group all these different data points into clusters,False,False,good,,,,,,
that is number one thing that howard did number two thing that howard did is he made us realize it is another very critical point he made us realize the importance of what he likes to call horizontal segmentation why is this critical because this is the way the food industry thought before howard what were they obsessed with in the early they were obsessed with mustard in particular they were obsessed with the story of grey used to be there were two mustards french s and what were they yellow mustard what s in it yellow mustard seeds and paprika,False,False,good,,,,,,
better mustard a more expensive mustard a mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning and howard looked to that and said that is wrong mustard does not exist on a hierarchy mustard exists just like tomato sauce on a horizontal plane,False,False,good,,,,,,
for the longest time in the food industry there was a sense that there was one way a perfect way to make a dish you go to chez they give you the red tail with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction they dont give you five options on the reduction they dont say do you want the extra chunky reduction or no you just get the reduction,False,False,good,,,,,,
they dont give you five options on the reduction they dont say do you want the extra chunky reduction or no you just get the reduction why because the chef at chez has a platonic notion about red tail this is the way it ought to be and she serves it that way time and time again and if you quarrel with her she will say you know what youre wrong this is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well,False,False,good,,,,,,
im afraid im one of those speakers you hope youre not going to meet at ted first i dont have a mobile so im on the safe side secondly a political theorist who is going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about and plus im not going to give you any answers im much more trying to add to some of the questions were talking about and one of the things that i want to question is this very popular hope these days that transparency and openness can restore the trust in democratic institutions there is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me you people the church of ted are a very optimistic community,True,True,good,,,,,,
as you have been told im bulgarian and according to the surveys we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world,True,True,good,,,,,,
so now when you know what to expect let us give you the story and this is a rainy election day in a small country that can be my country but could be also your country and because of the rain until four oclock in the afternoon nobody went to the polling stations but then the rain stopped people went to vote and when the votes had been counted three fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot the government and the opposition they have been simply paralyzed,False,False,good,,,,,,
but then the rain stopped people went to vote and when the votes had been counted three fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot the government and the opposition they have been simply paralyzed because you know what to do about the protests you know who to arrest who to negotiate with but what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot so the government decided to have the elections once again and this time even a greater number percent of the people voted with blank ballots basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for this is the opening of a beautiful novel by jose called seeing,False,False,good,,,,,,
now i started to notice this when i actually showed star wars to my daughter which was years later and the situation was different at that point i also had a son he was only three at the time he was not invited to the screening he was too young for that but he was the second child and the level of supervision had plummeted,True,False,bad,,,,,,

a compound that has been tested in mice is useful in preventing the action of the gene is the most common form of dwarfism and mice who have been given that substance and who have the gene grow to full size testing in humans is around the corner there are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies or to terminate them and so we have both social progress and medical progress and i believe in both of them i believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful and i think the same thing about the medical progress but i think it is a tragedy when one of them doesnt see the other and when i see the way theyre intersecting in conditions like the three ive just described i sometimes think it is like those moments in grand opera when the hero realizes he loves the heroine at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan,True,True,good,,,,,,
and i thought here i had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of parenting children who are disabled and i didnt want to join their number because what i was encountering was an idea of illness and like all parents since the dawn of time i wanted to protect my child from illness and i wanted also to protect myself from illness and yet i knew from the work i had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for that those would ultimately be his identity and if they were his identity they would become my identity that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded we took him to the machine we took him to the cat scanner we took this day old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw we felt helpless and at the end of five hours they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly and when i asked the pediatrician what had been going on she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp,True,False,bad,,,,,,
when i was little my mother used to say the love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world and until you have children you dont know what it is like and when i was little i took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about parenting my brother and me and when i was an adolescent i thought that im gay and so i probably cant have a family and when she said it it made me anxious,False,False,good,,,,,,
and when i was an adolescent i thought that im gay and so i probably cant have a family and when she said it it made me anxious and after i came out of the closet when she continued to say it it made me furious i said im gay that is not the direction that im headed in and i want you to stop saying that about years ago i was asked by my editors at the new york times magazine to write a piece about deaf culture and i was rather taken aback i had thought of deafness entirely as an illness,False,False,good,,,,,,
and as i plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world i become convinced that deafness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said we dont lack hearing we have membership in a culture were saying something that was viable it wasnt my culture and i didnt particularly want to rush off and join it but i appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it it felt as valuable as latino culture or gay culture or jewish culture it felt as valid perhaps even as american culture then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf and when her daughter was born she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me she was facing the question of what to do with this child,False,False,good,,,,,,
then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf and when her daughter was born she suddenly found herself confronting questions that now began to seem quite resonant to me she was facing the question of what to do with this child should she say youre just like everyone else but a little bit shorter or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity get involved in the little people of america become aware of what was happening for dwarfs and i suddenly thought most deaf children are born to hearing parents those hearing parents tend to try to cure them those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence most gay people are born to straight parents those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world and those gay people have to discover identity later on,False,False,good,,,,,,
most gay people are born to straight parents those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstream world and those gay people have to discover identity later on and here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter and i thought there it is again a family that perceives itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary and i hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity there are vertical identities which are passed down generationally from parent to child those are things like ethnicity frequently nationality language often religion those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children and while some of them can be difficult there is no attempt to cure them,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is clear that bilateral cooperation is essential it is clear that multilateral cooperation is essential it is clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility in order to be able to invest more massively in support to these countries we need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today in protracted situations at a certain moment that it doesnt make sense anymore to make a distinction between humanitarian aid and development aid or development processes because you are talking about children in school you are talking about health you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded you are talking about things that require a long term perspective a development perspective and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective i would like your comment on something that was in newspapers this morning it is a statement made by the current front runner for the republican nomination for us president donald trump yesterday he said this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
commissioner thank you for coming to ted pleasure let us start with a figure during almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in europe from many different countries of course from syria and iraq but also from afghanistan and bangladesh and eritrea and elsewhere and there have been reactions of two different kinds welcoming parties and border fences but i want to look at it a little bit from the short term and the long term perspective,False,False,good,,,,,,
no this idea has been around for a while here s a quotation even if we could keep the machines in a subservient position for instance by turning off the power at strategic moments and ill come back to that turning off the power idea later on we should as a species feel greatly humbled so who said this this is alan turing in alan turing as you know is the father of computer science and in many ways the father of ai as well so if we think about this problem the problem of creating something more intelligent than your own species we might call this the gorilla problem because ancestors did this a few million years ago and now we can ask the gorillas was this a good idea so here they are having a meeting to discuss whether it was a good idea and after a little while they conclude no this was a terrible idea our species is in dire straits in fact you can see the existential sadness in their eyes,True,True,good,,,,,,
putting in the wrong objective is not the only part of the problem there is another part if you put an objective into a machine even something as simple as fetch the coffee the machine says to itself well how might i fail to fetch the coffee someone might switch me off ok i have to take steps to prevent that i will disable my switch i will do anything to defend myself against interference with this objective that i have been given so this single minded pursuit in a very defensive mode of an objective that is in fact not aligned with the true objectives of the human race that is the problem that we face and in fact that is the high value from this talk if you want to remember one thing it is that you cant fetch the coffee if youre dead,True,True,good,,,,,,
it is very simple just remember that repeat it to yourself three times a day,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i cant do that im meeting with the secretary general at how could this have happened well i did warn you but you overrode my recommendation well what am i going to do i cant just tell him im too busy dont worry i arranged for his plane to be delayed,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so the values here there is a slight mistake going on this is clearly following my wife s values which is happy wife happy life,True,True,good,,,,,,
there are reasons for optimism one reason is there is a massive amount of data because remember i said theyre going to read everything the human race has ever written most of what we write about is human beings doing things and other people getting upset about it so there is a massive amount of data to learn from there is also a very strong economic incentive to get this right so imagine your domestic robot s at home youre late from work again and the robot has to feed the kids and the kids are hungry and there is nothing in the fridge and the robot sees the cat,True,True,good,,,,,,
and the robot hasnt quite learned the human value function properly so it doesnt understand the sentimental value of the cat outweighs the nutritional value of the cat,True,False,bad,,,,,,
arai mentioned that reading is not yet happening in machines at least with understanding but that will happen and when that happens very soon afterwards machines will have read everything that the human race has ever written and that will enable machines along with the ability to look further ahead than humans can as weve already seen in go if they also have access to more information theyll be able to make better decisions in the real world than we can so is that a good thing well i hope so our entire civilization everything that we value is based on our intelligence and if we had access to a lot more intelligence then there is really no limit to what the human race can do and i think this could be as some people have described it the biggest event in human history,False,False,good,,,,,,
im trying to redefine ai to get away from this classical notion of machines that intelligently pursue objectives there are three principles involved the first one is a principle of altruism if you like that the robot s only objective is to maximize the realization of human objectives of human values and by values here i dont mean touchy feely goody goody values i just mean whatever it is that the human would prefer their life to be like and so this actually violates asimov s law that the robot has to protect its own existence it has no interest in preserving its existence whatsoever the second law is a law of humility if you like,False,False,good,,,,,,
so this seems to be inevitable right this kind of failure mode seems to be inevitable and it follows from having a concrete definite objective so what happens if the machine is uncertain about the objective well it reasons in a different way it says ok the human might switch me off but only if im doing something wrong well i dont really know what wrong is but i know that i dont want to do it,False,False,good,,,,,,
it says ok the human might switch me off but only if im doing something wrong well i dont really know what wrong is but i know that i dont want to do it so that is the first and second principles right there so i should let the human switch me off and in fact you can calculate the incentive that the robot has to allow the human to switch it off and it is directly tied to the degree of uncertainty about the underlying objective and then when the machine is switched off that third principle comes into play it learns something about the objectives it should be pursuing because it learns that what it did wasnt right in fact we can with suitable use of greek symbols as mathematicians usually do we can actually prove a theorem that says that such a robot is beneficial to the human you are better off with a machine that is designed in this way than without it,False,False,good,,,,,,
i dont want my robot to behave like me i sneak down in the middle of the night and take stuff from the fridge i do this and that there s all kinds of things you dont want the robot doing,False,False,good,,,,,,
i sneak down in the middle of the night and take stuff from the fridge i do this and that there is all kinds of things you dont want the robot doing but in fact it doesnt quite work that way just because you behave badly doesnt mean the robot is going to copy your behavior it is going to understand your motivations and maybe help you resist them if appropriate but it is still difficult what were trying to do in fact is to allow machines to predict for any person and for any possible life that they could live and the lives of everybody else which would they prefer and there are many many difficulties involved in doing this i dont expect that this is going to get solved very quickly the real difficulties in fact are us,False,False,good,,,,,,
as i have already mentioned we behave badly in fact some of us are downright nasty now the robot as i said doesnt have to copy the behavior the robot does not have any objective of its own it is purely altruistic and it is not designed just to satisfy the desires of one person the user but in fact it has to respect the preferences of everybody so it can deal with a certain amount of nastiness and it can even understand that your nastiness for example you may take bribes as a passport official because you need to feed your family and send your kids to school,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it is not designed just to satisfy the desires of one person the user but in fact it has to respect the preferences of everybody so it can deal with a certain amount of nastiness and it can even understand that your nastiness for example you may take bribes as a passport official because you need to feed your family and send your kids to school it can understand that it doesnt mean it is going to steal in fact itll just help you send your kids to school we are also limited lee is a brilliant go player but he still lost so if we look at his actions he took an action that lost the game that doesnt mean he wanted to lose so to understand his behavior we actually have to invert through a model of human cognition that includes our computational limitations a very complicated model,False,False,good,,,,,,
said you jerk only jerk wasnt the word i used i said you couldve gotten me fired and he said let us get married,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i saw it firsthand just days before terence died his oncologist said tell terence that better days are just ahead days before he died yet ira the director of palliative medicine at dartmouth said you know the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal so what the experts call denial i call hope and id like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design you just redefine denial and hope and it becomes a feature of being human it is not a bug it s a feature,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so id like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in china the night i met my husband it was a city so long ago that it was still called peking so i went to a party i sat down next to a stout middle aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie and he turned out to be a fulbright scholar there in china specifically to study sino soviet relations what a gift it was to the eager young foreign correspondent that i was then id pump him for information im mentally scribbling notes for the stories i plan to write,False,False,good,,,,,,

and so three days later driving very fast i found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell capable of producing grapefruit size hail and spectacular tornadoes although only two percent actually do these clouds can grow so big up to miles wide and reach up to feet into the atmosphere they can grow so big blocking all daylight making it very dark and ominous standing under them storm chasing is a very tactile experience there is a warm moist wind blowing at your back and the smell of the earth the wheat the grass the charged particles and then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming the greens and the turquoise blues ive learned to respect the lightning my hair used to be straight,True,True,good,,,,,,
everything is interconnected as a indian i was raised to know this we are a small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of long island near the town of southampton in new york when i was a little girl my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day there were no clouds in the sky and after a while i began to perspire,False,False,good,,,,,,
what really excites me about these storms is their movement the way they swirl and spin and undulate with their lava lamp like clouds they become lovely monsters when im photographing them i cannot help but remember my grandfather s lesson as i stand under them i see not just a cloud but understand that what i have the privilege to witness is the same forces the same process in a small scale version that helped to create our galaxy our solar system our sun and even this very planet all my relations thank you,False,False,good,,,,,,

emotional correctness is the tone the feeling how we say what we say the respect and compassion we show one another and what ive realized is that political persuasion doesnt begin with ideas or facts or data political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct so when i first went to go work at fox news true confession i expected there to be marks in the carpet from all the knuckle dragging that by the way in case youre paying attention is not emotionally correct but liberals on my side we can be self righteous we can be condescending we can be dismissive of anyone who doesnt agree with us in other words we can be politically right but emotionally wrong and incidentally that means that people dont like us,False,False,good,,,,,,
now here s the kicker conservatives are really nice i mean not all of them and not the ones who send me hate mail but you would be surprised sean hannity is one of the sweetest guys ive ever met he spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates and i know that if i ever had a problem he would do anything he could to help now i think sean hannity is percent politically wrong but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive,False,False,good,,,,,,

similarly the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history again in the warner brothers did that for you now go to you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom this double impact is a massive redefinition of the cultural market a time when anyone is a potential author frankly what were seeing now in this environment is a massive time when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting but the number of arts participants people who write poetry who sing songs who perform in church choirs is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations,False,False,good,,,,,,
so normally most people begin by themselves to the task they talk about it they figure out what it is going to look like they jockey for power then they spend some time planning organizing they sketch and they lay out spaghetti they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures and then finally just as theyre running out of time someone takes out the marshmallow and then they gingerly put it on top and then they stand back and ta da they admire their work but what really happens most of the time is that the ta da turns into an uh oh because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse so there are a number of people who have a lot more uh oh moments than others and among the worst are recent graduates of business school,True,True,good,,,,,,
and of course there are teams that have a lot more ta da structures and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan right and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens it is a crisis sound familiar right what do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and they build prototypes successive prototypes always keeping the marshmallow on top so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process and with each version kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesnt work so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential but let us look at how different teams perform so the average for most people is around inches business schools students about half of that lawyers a little better but not much better than that better than most adults who does the very best architects and engineers thankfully,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so a little bit better than average but here s where it gets interesting if you put you put an executive on the team they get significantly better,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and so i thought this was an interesting idea and i incorporated it into a design workshop and it was a huge success,False,False,good,,,,,,
as peter tells us not only do they produce the tallest structures but theyre the most interesting structures of them all so the question you want to ask is how come why what is it about them and peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be of spaghetti inc right they dont spend time jockeying for power but there is another reason as well and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan right and then they execute on it and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens it is a crisis sound familiar right,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then what happens is when they put the marshmallow on the top they run out of time and what happens it is a crisis sound familiar right,False,False,good,,,,,,
and why is that because they have special skills of facilitation they manage the process they understand the process and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team s performance,False,False,good,,,,,,
so let me first take the us of relationship and here forgive me if i get personal once upon a time a very long time ago i was a old undergraduate studying philosophy i was into nietzsche and and sartre and camus i was full of ontological uncertainty and existential angst it was terrific,True,True,good,,,,,,

these kinds of dependencies are largely missed by standard risk management tools which ignore them and see lizards when they should see dragon kings the root mechanism of a dragon king is a slow maturation towards instability which is the bubble and the climax of the bubble is often the crash this is similar to the slow heating of water in this test tube reaching the boiling point where the instability of the water occurs and you have the phase transition to vapor and this process which is absolutely non linear cannot be predicted by standard techniques is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior which is fundamentally so the cause of the crash the cause of the crisis has to be found in an inner instability of the system and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur now some of you may have come to the mind that is this not related to the black swan concept you have heard about frequently remember black swan is this rare bird that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief that all swans should be white so it has captured the idea of unpredictability that the extreme events are fundamentally unknowable nothing can be further from the dragon king concept i propose which is exactly the opposite that most extreme events are actually and predictable so we can be empowered and take responsibility and make predictions about them so let us have my dragon king burn this black swan concept,True,True,good,,,,,,

and you can think of different formats so for instance if youre afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle we do arrays what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that is made of silk just to give you a sense of size you can do bigger things you can do gears and nuts and bolts that you can buy at whole foods and the gears work in water as well so you think of alternative mechanical parts and maybe you can use that liquid kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins for example or maybe an entire bone and so you have here a little example of a small skull what we call mini,True,True,good,,,,,,
silk during its self assembly process acts like a cocoon for biological matter and so if you change the recipe and you add things when you pour so you add things to your liquid silk solution where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines the self assembly process preserves the biological function of these so it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive so that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together a fractured bone together and deliver drugs at the same while your bone is healing for example or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge so weve made a silk card with penicillin in it and we stored penicillin at degrees c so degrees fahrenheit for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin and so that could be that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels,True,True,good,,,,,,
thank you im thrilled to be here im going to talk about a new old material that still continues to amaze us and that might impact the way we think about material science high technology and maybe along the way also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation so that is kind of a bold statement ill tell you a little bit more this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true,False,False,good,,,,,,
ill tell you a little bit more this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true it is sustainable it is a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature and is biodegradable with a clock so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years it is edible it is implantable in the human body without causing any immune response it actually gets reintegrated in the body and it is technological so it can do things like microelectronics and maybe do and the material looks something like this in fact this material you see is clear and transparent the components of this material are just water and protein,False,False,good,,,,,,

you see sight is just one way we shape our reality we create our own realities in many other ways let us take fear as just one example your fears distort your reality under the warped logic of fear anything is better than the uncertain fear fills the void at all costs passing off what you dread for what you know offering up the worst in place of the ambiguous substituting assumption for reason psychologists have a great term for it,True,True,good,,,,,,

we make assumptions and faulty leaps of logic we harbor bias we know that we are right and they are wrong we fear the worst we strive for unattainable perfection we tell ourselves what we can and cannot do in our minds fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads and we dont even notice them im going to tell you five facts about myself one fact is not true,False,False,good,,,,,,
now did you struggle with number four my blindness why is that we make assumptions about so called disabilities as a blind man i confront others incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day my point today is not about my blindness however it s about my vision,False,False,good,,,,,,
as a blind man i confront others incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day my point today is not about my blindness however it is about my vision going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open it taught me to spot those backwards swimming fish that our minds create going blind cast them into focus what does it feel like to see it is immediate and passive you open your eyes and there is the world seeing is believing,False,False,good,,,,,,
what does it feel like to see it is immediate and passive you open your eyes and there is the world seeing is believing sight is truth right well that is what i thought then from age to my progressively deteriorated my sight became an increasingly bizarre carnival hall of mirrors and illusions the salesperson i was relieved to spot in a store was really a mannequin reaching down to wash my hands i suddenly saw it was a i was touching not a sink when my fingers felt its true shape,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we did and a lot of people got upset about that but as we passed that information around suddenly you find that information is only of value if you give it to people who have the ability to do something with it the fact that i know something has zero value if im not the person who can actually make something better because of it so as a consequence what we did was we changed the idea of information instead of knowledge is power to one where sharing is power it was the fundamental shift not new tactics not new weapons not new anything else it was the idea that we were now part of a team in which information became the essential link between us not a block between us and i want everybody to take a deep breath and let it out because in your life there is going to be information that leaks out youre not going to like somebody s going to get my college grades out a that is going to be a disaster,True,False,bad,,,,,,
in the summer of i was assigned to command a special operations task force and that task force was spread across the mideast to fight al our main effort was inside iraq and our specified mission was to defeat al in iraq for almost five years i stayed there and we focused on fighting a war that was unconventional and it was difficult and it was bloody and it often claimed its highest price among innocent people we did everything we could to stop al and the foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers and as accelerants to the violence we honed our combat skills we developed new equipment we parachuted we we took small boats we drove and we walked to objectives night after night to stop the killing that this network was putting forward we bled we died and we killed to stop that organization from the violence that they were putting largely against the iraqi people now we did what we knew how we had grown up and one of the things that we knew that was in our was secrecy it was security,False,False,good,,,,,,
so needless to say this is not a solution for everybody and this actually is part of the problem because if you think about communication by definition it involves having someone to communicate with so while does a great job of what it is designed to do for the people out there who cant understand how to use it the option to communicate privately simply does not exist and this is a problem that we need to solve so if we want to have privacy online the only way we can succeed is if we get the whole world on board and this is only possible if we bring down the barrier to entry i think this is actually the key challenge that lies in the tech community what we really have to do is work and make privacy more accessible so last summer when the edward snowden story came out several colleagues and i decided to see if we could make this happen at that time we were working at the european organization for nuclear research at the world s largest particle collider which collides protons by the way we were all scientists so we used our scientific creativity and came up with a very creative name for our project,True,False,bad,,,,,,

the word concussion evokes a fear these days more so than it ever has and i know this personally i played years of football was struck in the head thousands of times and i have to tell you though what was much worse than that was a pair of bike accidents i had where i suffered concussions and im still dealing with the effects of the most recent one today as i stand in front of you there is a fear around concussion that does have some evidence behind it there is information that a repeated history of concussion can lead to early dementia such as alzheimer s and chronic traumatic encephalopathy that was the subject of the will smith movie concussion,False,False,good,,,,,,

that is what i thought so like me at a few of you may have also taken wrong turns and fallen in love with the wrong person maybe even your boss unlike me though your boss probably wasnt the president of the united states of america of course life is full of surprises not a day goes by that im not reminded of my mistake and i regret that mistake deeply in after having been swept up into an improbable romance i was then swept up into the eye of a political legal and media maelstrom like we had never seen before remember just a few years earlier news was consumed from just three places reading a newspaper or magazine listening to the radio or watching television that was it but that wasnt my fate,False,False,good,,,,,,
for me it was really about the process it wasnt about the end result and that is the beautiful thing about the camera they used to say the pen is mightier than the sword i think the camera is and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually so anyway we began the journey and here you see people like mary robinson i went to see in geneva im cutting my hair it is getting short and long because every time i saw kofi annan i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it and that was kind of what was going on,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i couldnt understand the starvation the destruction the killing of innocent people making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do and when i was i became an actor i was bottom of the class i havent got any qualifications,False,False,good,,,,,,
another beautifully designed new building ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch it is fine during the day when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight but at dusk everything changes the architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass for his new office tower and then left it to a contractor to install these switches behind them we know instinctively where to reach when we enter a dark room we automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward but the sound we are greeted with as the room is bathed in the simulated glow of late afternoon light recalls to mind a dirty men s room in the rear of a greek coffee shop,True,True,good,,,,,,
today these improvements seem somehow the click is the modern triumphal clarion proceeding us through life announcing our entry into every room the sound made flicking a wall switch off is of a completely different nature it has a deep melancholy ring children dont like it it s why they leave lights on around the house,True,True,good,,,,,,
so buried in signage are these structures that it often takes a moment to distinguish the modern specially constructed taxpayer from its neighbor the small commercial building from an earlier century whose upper floors have been sealed and whose space now functions as a taxpayer the few surfaces not covered by signs are often clad in a distinctive dark green gray aluminum siding take out sandwich shops film processing drop offs peep shows and necktie stores now these provisional structures have in some cases remained standing for the better part of a human lifetime the temporary building is a triumph of modern industrial organization a healthy of the urge to build and proof that not every architectural idea need be set in stone that s the end,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we have fading memories of that provisional temple erected each time an adult sat down on a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on it is children and teenage girls who are most keenly aware of its architectural beauty they understand the structural integrity of a deep avuncular lap as compared to the shaky arrangement of a neurotic niece in high heels the relationship between the lap and its owner is direct and intimate i envision a residential high rise a reason to consider the mental health of any architect before granting an important commission the bathrooms and kitchens will of course have no windows the lap of luxury is an architectural construct of childhood which we seek in vain as adults to employ that s the end,True,True,good,,,,,,
pears dried in the form of genital organs apricot halves like the ears of in the unsold stock was purchased by maurice a wealthy prune juice bottler and consolidated to form the core collection as an art form it lies somewhere between still life painting and plumbing upon his death in a quarter of the items were sold off for compote to a high class hotel restaurant,True,True,good,,,,,,
the next story is called in praise of the taxpayer that so many of the city s most venerable taxpayers have survived yet another commercial building boom is cause for celebration these one or two story structures designed to yield only enough income to cover the taxes on the land on which they stand were not meant to be permanent buildings yet for one reason or another they have confounded the efforts of developers to be combined into lots suitable for high rise construction although they make no claim to architectural beauty they are in their perfect a delightful alternative to the large scale structures that might someday take their place the most perfect examples occupy corner lots,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the next story is called on the human lap for the ancient egyptians the lap was a platform upon which to place the earthly possessions of the dead from foot to knee it was not until the century that an italian painter recognized the lap as a grecian temple upholstered in flesh and cloth over the next years we see the infant christ go from a sitting to a standing position on the virgin s lap and then back again every child recapitulates this ascension straddling one or both legs sitting sideways or leaning against the body from there to the modern dummy is but a brief moment in history,False,False,good,,,,,,
from there to the modern dummy is but a brief moment in history you were late for school again this morning the must first make us believe that a small boy is sitting on his lap the illusion of speech follows incidentally what have you got to say for yourself jimmy as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance we have fading memories of that provisional temple erected each time an adult sat down on a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on,False,False,good,,,,,,
but this is just a primitive beginning even siri is just a passive tool in fact for the last three half million years the tools that weve had have been completely passive they do exactly what we tell them and nothing more our very first tool only cut where we struck it the chisel only carves where the artist points it and even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction in fact to date and this is something that frustrates me weve always been limited by this need to manually push our wills into our tools like manual literally using our hands even with computers but im more like scotty in star trek,True,True,good,,,,,,
i want to have a conversation with a computer i want to say computer let us design a car and the computer shows me a car and i say no more fast looking and less german and bang the computer shows me an option,True,True,good,,,,,,
give you an example in the case of this aerial drone chassis all you would need to do is tell it something like it has four propellers you want it to be as lightweight as possible and you need it to be aerodynamically efficient then what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria millions of them it takes big computers to do this but it comes back to us with designs that we by ourselves never couldve imagined and the computer s coming up with this stuff all by itself no one ever drew anything and it started completely from scratch and by the way it is no accident that the drone body looks just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel,True,True,good,,,,,,
weve been working with airbus for a couple of years on this concept plane for the future it is a ways out still but just recently we used a generative design ai to come up with this this is a printed cabin partition that is been designed by a computer it is stronger than the original yet half the weight and it will be flying in the airbus later this year so computers can now generate they can come up with their own solutions to our well defined problems but theyre not intuitive they still have to start from scratch every single time and that is because they never learn unlike maggie,True,True,good,,,,,,
watson beats these two humans at jeopardy which is much harder for a computer to play than chess is in fact rather than working from recipes watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents and then a couple of weeks ago beats the world s best human at go which is the most difficult game that we have in fact in go there are more possible moves than there are atoms in the universe so in order to win what had to do was develop intuition and in fact at some points programmers didnt understand why was doing what it was doing and things are moving really fast i mean consider in the space of a human lifetime computers have gone from a child s game to what is recognized as the pinnacle of strategic thought what s basically happening is computers are going from being like spock to being a lot more like kirk,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so what about making all of this crazy new stuff that were going to invent and design i think the era of human augmentation is as much about the physical world as it is about the virtual intellectual realm how will technology augment us in the physical world robotic systems ok there is certainly a fear that robots are going to take jobs away from humans and that is true in certain sectors but im much more interested in this idea that humans and robots working together are going to augment each other and start to inhabit a new space this is our applied research lab in san francisco where one of our areas of focus is advanced robotics specifically human robot collaboration and this is bishop one of our robots as an experiment we set it up to help a person working in construction doing repetitive tasks tasks like cutting out holes for outlets or light switches in drywall,True,True,good,,,,,,
so as computers are going to augment our ability to imagine and design new stuff robotic systems are going to help us build and make things that weve never been able to make before but what about our ability to sense and control these things what about a nervous system for the things that we make our nervous system the human nervous system tells us everything that is going on around us but the nervous system of the things we make is rudimentary at best for instance a car doesnt tell the city s public works department that it just hit a pothole at the corner of broadway and morrison a building doesnt tell its designers whether or not the people inside like being there and the toy manufacturer doesnt know if a toy is actually being played with how and where and whether or not it is any fun look im sure that the designers imagined this lifestyle for barbie when they designed her,True,True,good,,,,,,
entrepreneurs artists or maybe you just have a really big imagination show of hands that is most of you i have some news for us over the course of the next years more will change around the way we do our work than has happened in the last,False,False,good,,,,,,
in fact for the last three half million years the tools that weve had have been completely passive,False,False,good,,,,,,
actually smarter than our most advanced design tools what do i mean by that if her owner picks up that leash maggie knows with a fair degree of certainty it is time to go for a walk and how did she learn well every time the owner picked up the leash they went for a walk and maggie did three things she had to pay attention she had to remember what happened and she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind,False,False,good,,,,,,
interestingly that is exactly what computer scientists have been trying to get ais to do for the last or so years back in they built this computer that could play tic big deal then years later in deep blue beats kasparov at chess watson beats these two humans at jeopardy which is much harder for a computer to play than chess is in fact rather than working from recipes watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents and then a couple of weeks ago beats the world s best human at go which is the most difficult game that we have,False,False,good,,,,,,
the goal of this project which we called the hive was to prototype the experience of humans computers and robots all working together to solve a highly complex design problem the humans acted as labor they cruised around the construction site they manipulated the bamboo which by the way because it is a non material is super hard for robots to deal with but then the robots did this fiber winding which was almost impossible for a human to do and then we had an ai that was controlling everything it was telling the humans what to do telling the robots what to do and keeping track of thousands of individual components what is interesting is building this pavilion was simply not possible without human robot and ai augmenting each other ok ill share one more project this one s a little bit crazy,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then we did something crazy,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think were going to see a world where were moving from things that are fabricated to things that are farmed where were moving from things that are constructed to that which is grown were going to move from being isolated to being connected and well move away from extraction to embrace i also think well shift from craving obedience from our things to valuing autonomy thanks to our augmented capabilities our world is going to change dramatically were going to have a world with more variety more more dynamism more complexity more adaptability and of course more beauty,False,False,good,,,,,,
somehow these sounds represent the word and the concept how does this happen there is something amazing going on about representing stuff so i want to talk about that magic that happens when we actually represent something here you see just lines with different widths they stand for numbers for a particular book and i can actually recommend this book it is a very nice book,True,False,bad,,,,,,
are all nice representations but i want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number here you see two circles im going to rotate them like this observe the upper left one it goes a little bit faster right you can see this it actually goes exactly four thirds as fast that means that when it goes around four times the other one goes around three times now let us make two lines and draw this dot where the lines meet we get this dot dancing around,True,True,good,,,,,,
the sound of four thirds what im doing now im changing my perspective im just viewing a number from another perspective i can even do this with rhythms right i can take a rhythm and play three beats at one time in a period of time and i can play another sound four times in that same space sounds kind of boring but listen to them together,True,True,good,,,,,,
so my day definition of mathematics that i use every day is the following first of all it is about finding patterns and by pattern i mean a connection a structure some regularity some rules that govern what we see second of all i think it is about representing these patterns with a language we make up language if we dont have it and in mathematics this is essential it is also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens were going to do that very soon and finally it is about doing cool stuff mathematics enables us to do so many things so let us have a look at these patterns,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is a language we made up for the patterns of tie knots and a half windsor is all that this is a mathematics book about tying shoelaces at the university level because there are patterns in shoelaces you can do it in so many different ways we can analyze it we can make up languages for it and representations are all over mathematics this is notation from he invented a language for patterns in nature when we throw something up in the air it falls down,False,False,good,,,,,,
and representations are all over mathematics this is notation from he invented a language for patterns in nature when we throw something up in the air it falls down why were not sure but we can represent this with mathematics in a pattern this is also a pattern this is also an invented language can you guess for what it is actually a notation system for dancing for tap dancing that enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff to do new things because he has represented it,False,False,good,,,,,,

i search for the truth in this eternal quest my not fashion you can see how im dressed psychopathic words in my head appear whisper these lyrics only i can hear art the art of discovering and that which is hovering inside the mind of those unconfined all of these words keep pouring out like rain i need a mad scientist to check my brain stop i guarantee you that will never happen again,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i am a surgeon who studies creativity and i have never had a patient tell me i really want you to be creative during surgery and so i guess there is a little bit of irony to it i will say though that after having done surgery a lot it is similar to playing a musical instrument and for me this deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and to study the science of sound particularly music im going to talk over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how im able to study music and try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative ive done most of this work at johns hopkins university and at the national institute of health where i was previously ill go over some science experiments and cover three musical experiments,False,False,good,,,,,,
what i do in my lab i ask questions about what is the brain doing to enable us to do this this is the main method that i use this is functional if youve been in an scanner it is very much the same but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain the way that is done is by the following there is something called bold imaging which is blood oxygen level dependent imaging when youre in an scanner youre in a big magnet that is aligning your molecules in certain areas when an area of the brain is active meaning a neural area is active it gets blood flow shunted to that area,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is a tunnel that is abandoned in hell s kitchen i was there alone setting up and a homeless man approached i was basically intruding in his living space i was really frightened at first but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project and he didnt seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on self timer and ran back and forth and when i was done he actually offered me his shirt to wipe off my feet and kindly walked me out it must have been a very unusual day for him,True,True,good,,,,,,
this is a german bunker nearby there is a french bunker and the whole tunnel system is so complex that the two parties never met the tunnels are famous for having been used by the resistance which victor hugo wrote about in les miserables and i saw a lot of graffiti from the like this one after exploring the underground of paris i decided to climb up and i climbed a gothic monument that is right in the middle of paris this is the tower of saint jacques it was built in the early i dont recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of january naked it was not very comfortable,True,True,good,,,,,,
i was raised in seoul korea and moved to new york city in to attend college i was pre med at the time and i thought i would become a surgeon because i was interested in anatomy and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity at the same time i fell in love with new york city i started to realize that i could look at the whole city as a living organism i wanted to dissect it and look into its unseen layers and the way to it for me was through artistic means,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the way to it for me was through artistic means so eventually i decided to pursue an instead of an m d and in grad school i became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city in new york city rats are part of daily lives most people ignore them or are frightened of them but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society and even though theyre used in labs to promote human lives theyre also considered pests i also started looking around in the city and trying to photograph them,False,False,good,,,,,,
but let us move on to stage two now stage one youll notice says in effect life sucks so this other book that steve mentioned that just came out called the three laws of performance my colleague steve and i argue that as people see the world so they behave well if people see the world in such a way that life sucks then their behavior will follow automatically from that it will be despairing hostility theyll do whatever it takes to survive even if that means undermining other people now my birthday is coming up shortly and my driver s license expires and the reason that that is relevant is that very soon i will be walking into what we call a stage two tribe which looks like this,True,True,good,,,,,,
now when we go on to stage three this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us because it is in stage three that many of us move and we park and we stay stage three says im great and youre not,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way but when we talked to people it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states now what is a tribe a tribe is a group of about so kind of more than a team to about people and it is within these tribes that all of our work gets done but not just work it is within these tribes that societies get built that important things happen and so as we surveyed the if you will representatives from various tribal councils that met also known as super bowl parties we sent the following email off to newspaper editors the following day february we posted it on our website this was before super tuesday,False,False,good,,,,,,
february we posted it on our website this was before super tuesday we said the tribes that were in are saying it is going to be now the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous years studying tribes studying these naturally occurring groups all of you are members of tribes in walking around at the break many of you had met members of your tribe and you were talking to them and many of you were doing what great if you will tribal leaders do which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe and make introductions that is in fact what great tribal leaders do,False,False,good,,,,,,
i am failing as a woman i am failing as a feminist i have passionate opinions about gender equality but i worry that to freely accept the label of feminist would not be fair to good feminists im a feminist but im a rather bad one oh so i call myself a bad feminist or at least i wrote an essay and then i wrote a book called bad feminist and then in interviews people started calling me the bad feminist,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself and a willful provocation has become a thing let me take a step back when i was younger mostly in my teens and i had strange ideas about feminists as hairy angry man hating sex hating women as if those are bad things,True,True,good,,,,,,
some of my transgressions are more flagrant if a woman wants to take her husband s name that is her choice and it is not my place to judge if a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children i embrace that choice too the problem is not that she makes herself economically vulnerable in that choice the problem is that our society is set up to make women economically vulnerable when they choose let us deal with that i reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color working class women queer women and women in favor of supporting white and upper class straight women listen if that is good feminism i am a very bad feminist,True,True,good,,,,,,
back then i worried about the tone people used when suggesting i might be a feminist the feminist label was an accusation it was an f word and not a nice one i was labeled a woman who doesnt play by the rules who expects too much who thinks far too highly of myself by daring to believe im equal superior to a man you dont want to be that rebel woman until you realize that you very much are that woman and cannot imagine being anyone else as i got older i began to accept that i am indeed a feminist and a proud one i hold certain truths to be self evident women are equal to men,False,False,good,,,,,,
got older i began to accept that i am indeed a feminist and a proud one i hold certain truths to be self evident women are equal to men we deserve equal pay for equal work we have the right to move through the world as we choose free from harassment or violence we have the right to easy affordable access to birth control and reproductive services we have the right to make choices about our bodies free from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine we have the right to respect there is more when we talk about the needs of women we have to consider the other identities we inhabit,False,False,good,,,,,,
through writing and feminism i also found that if i was a little bit brave another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are in one hand i hold the power to accomplish anything and in my other i hold the humbling reality that i am just one woman i am a bad feminist i am a good woman i am trying to become better in how i think and what i say and what i do without abandoning everything that makes me human i hope that we can all do the same i hope that we can all be a little bit brave when we most need such bravery,False,False,good,,,,,,
im here today to talk about the two ideas that at least based on my observations at khan academy are kind of the core or the key leverage points for learning and it is the idea of mastery and the idea of mindset i saw this in the early days working with my cousins a lot of them were having trouble with math at first because they had all of these gaps accumulated in their learning and because of that at some point they got to an algebra class and they might have been a little bit shaky on some of the pre algebra and because of that they thought they didnt have the math gene or theyd get to a calculus class and theyd be a little bit shaky on the algebra i saw it in the early days when i was some of those videos on and i realized that people who were not my cousins were watching,True,True,good,,,,,,
at first those comments were just simple thank i thought that was a pretty big deal i dont know how much time you all spend on most of the comments are not thank you,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it might be logarithms or negative exponents and that process continues and you immediately start to realize how strange this is i didnt know percent of the more foundational thing and now im being pushed to the more advanced thing and this will continue for months years all the way until at some point i might be in an algebra class or class and i hit a wall and it is not because algebra is fundamentally difficult or because the student isnt bright it is because im seeing an equation and theyre dealing with exponents and that percent that i didnt know is showing up and then i start to disengage to appreciate how absurd that is imagine if we did other things in our life that way say home building,True,True,good,,,,,,
so we bring in the contractor and say we were told we have two weeks to build a foundation do what you can,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so they do what they can maybe it rains maybe some of the supplies dont show up and two weeks later the inspector comes looks around says ok the concrete is still wet right over there that part s not quite up to code ill give it an percent,True,True,good,,,,,,
by the time they got to algebra they had so many gaps in their knowledge they couldnt engage with it they thought they didnt have the math gene but when they were a bit older they took a little agency and decided to engage,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is the way you learn a musical instrument you practice the basic piece over and over again and only when youve mastered it you go on to the more advanced one but what we point out this is not the way a traditional academic model is structured the type of academic model that most of us grew up in in a traditional academic model we group students together usually by age and around middle school by age and perceived ability and we shepherd them all together at the same pace,False,False,good,,,,,,
second floor third floor and all of a sudden while youre building the third floor the whole structure collapses and if your reaction is the reaction you typically have in education or that a lot of folks have you might say maybe we had a bad contractor or maybe we needed better inspection or more frequent inspection but what was really broken was the process,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it is important to realize that not only will this make the student learn their exponents better but itll reinforce the right mindset muscles it makes them realize that if you got percent wrong on something it doesnt mean that you have a c branded in your somehow it means that you should just keep working on it,False,False,good,,,,,,
it would have to be personalized youd have to have private tutors and worksheets for every student and these arent new ideas there were experiments in winnetka illinois years ago where they did mastery based learning and saw great results but they said it wouldnt scale because it was logistically difficult the teacher had to give different worksheets to every student give on demand assessments,False,False,good,,,,,,
life was pretty good was a great year under clear blue skies in july in the wine region of ontario i got married surrounded by family and friends was a great year i graduated from school and i went on a road trip with two of my closest friends here s a picture of me and my friend chris on the coast of the pacific ocean we actually saw seals out of our car window and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them and then blocked them with our giant heads,True,True,good,,,,,,

over the last few years i havent had that much time to really think but lately i have had the opportunity to take a step back and ask myself what is it over the last few years that helped me grow my website but also grow myself and ive summarized those things for me personally as three as they are attitude awareness and authenticity id love to just talk about each one briefly so attitude look were all going to get lumps and were all going to get bumps none of us can predict the future but we do know one thing about it and that is that it aint gonna go according to plan we will all have high highs and big days and proud moments of smiles on graduation stages father daughter dances at weddings and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room but between those high highs we may also have some lumps and some bumps too it is sad and it is not pleasant to talk about but your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or your dog could get hit by a car on the street it s not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is sad and it is not pleasant to talk about but your husband might leave you your girlfriend could cheat your headaches might be more serious than you thought or your dog could get hit by a car on the street it is not a happy thought but your kids could get mixed up in gangs or bad scenes your mom could get cancer your dad could get mean and there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in i just really hope you feel like youve always got two choices one you can swirl and twirl and gloom and doom forever or two you can grieve and then face the future with newly sober eyes having a great attitude is about choosing option number two and choosing no matter how difficult it is no matter what pain hits you choosing to move forward and move on and take baby steps into the future the second a is awareness i love hanging out with three year olds i love the way that they see the world because theyre seeing the world for the first time,False,False,good,,,,,,
i love hanging out with three year olds i love the way that they see the world because theyre seeing the world for the first time i love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk i love the way that theyll stare slack jawed at their first baseball game with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts and the smell of the hotdogs i love the way that theyll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard and putting them into a nice centerpiece for thanksgiving dinner i love the way that they see the world because theyre seeing the world for the first time having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year old because you all used to be three years old that three boy is still part of you,False,False,good,,,,,,
because you all used to be three years old that three boy is still part of you that three girl is still part of you theyre in there and being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything youve seen for the first time once too so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work there was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery and smelt the bakery air or the first time you pulled a bill out of your old jacket pocket and said found money the last a is authenticity and for this one i want to tell you a quick story,False,False,good,,,,,,

i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous i went to prison difficult i worked in a coal mine dangerous i filmed in war zones difficult and dangerous and i spent days eating nothing but this fun in the beginning little difficult in the middle very dangerous in the end in fact most of my career ive been myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship i knew i would want to do something a little different so as some of you may or may not have heard a couple weeks ago i took out an ad on i sent out some messages some messages and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my ted talk,True,True,good,,,,,,
so what you were getting was this your name here presents my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and depending on the content could ultimately blow up in your face especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it but that being said it is a very good media opportunity,True,True,good,,,,,,
if youd have asked me that a year ago i wouldnt have been able to tell you that with any certainty but in the new project that im working on my new film we examine the world of marketing advertising and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years but nothing could prepare me nothing could ready me for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys,True,True,good,,,,,,
so i like the way you roll sergey brin no,True,True,good,,,,,,
you see we hear a lot about transparency these days our politicians say it our president says it even our say it but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality something suddenly changes but why well transparency is scary like that odd still screaming bear,True,True,good,,,,,,
we are a smaller brand much like you talked about being a smaller movie were very much a challenger brand so we dont have the budgets that other brands have so doing things like this you know remind people about ban is kind of why were interested in it what are the words that you would use to describe ban ban is blank that s a great question,True,False,bad,,,,,,
my brand is fedex because i deliver the goods failed writer alcoholic brand is that something im a lawyer brand im tom well we cant all be brand tom but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly,True,True,good,,,,,,
always believe is that if you take chances if you take risks that in those risks will come opportunity i believe that when you push people away from that youre pushing them more towards failure i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse then youre preparing your whole company to be reward challenged i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them ultimately moving forward i think we have to embrace fear weve got to put that bear in a cage,True,True,good,,,,,,
today more than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency has been brought to you by my good friends at who for bought the naming rights on turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world presents embrace transparency thank you very much guys so morgan in the name of transparency what exactly happened to that ms that is a fantastic question i have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the ted organization the sapling foundation a check for to be applied toward my attendance for next year s ted,True,True,good,,,,,,
want to do is make a film all about product placement marketing and advertising where the entire film is funded by product placement marketing and advertising so the movie will be called the greatest movie ever sold so what happens in the greatest movie ever sold is that everything from top to bottom from start to finish is branded from beginning to end from the above sponsor that youll see in the movie which is brand x now this brand the qualcomm stadium the staples center these people will be married to the film in perpetuity forever and so the film explores this whole idea michael kassan it is redundant it s what it is redundant,False,False,good,,,,,,
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity forever and so the film explores this whole idea michael kassan it is redundant it is what it is redundant in perpetuity forever im a redundant person im just saying that was more for emphasis it was in perpetuity forever,False,False,good,,,,,,
but not only are we going to have the brand x title sponsor but were going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore the greatest car you ever drove from the greatest movie ever sold the greatest drink youve ever had courtesy of the greatest movie ever sold xavier so the idea is beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life but actually get them to finance the film ms get them to finance the film and actually we show the whole process of how does it work the goal of this whole film is transparency youre going to see the whole thing take place in this movie,False,False,good,,,,,,
when you look at the people you deal with weve got some places we can go ms okay,False,False,good,,,,,,
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie i was amazed they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project,False,False,good,,,,,,
there is your story there is my story and there is the real story now you see with this film we wanted to tell the real story but with only one company one agency willing to help me and that is only because i knew john bond and richard kirshenbaum for years i realized that i would have to go on my own id have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team,False,False,good,,,,,,
who make great big giant hollywood films and i have friends who make little independent films like i make and the friends of mine who make big giant hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have and then my friends who make small independent films say well how are we supposed to compete with these big giant hollywood movies and the movie is called the greatest movie ever sold so how specifically will we see ban in the film any time im ready to go any time i open up my medicine cabinet you will see ban deodorant while anytime i do an interview with someone i can say are you fresh enough for this interview are you ready you look a little nervous i want to help you calm down so maybe you should put some one before the interview so well offer one of these fabulous scents whether it is a floral fusion or a paradise winds theyll have their chance,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think fresh is a great word that really spins this category into the positive versus fights odor and wetness it keeps you fresh how do we keep you fresher longer better freshness more freshness three times fresher,False,False,good,,,,,,
it was a smell that natalia recognized from cutting up skulls in her gross anatomy lab collagen collagen is what gives structure to our bones and usually after so many years it breaks down but in this case the arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it then a year or two later natalia was at a conference in bristol and she saw that a colleague of hers named mike buckley was this new process that he called collagen fingerprinting it turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone you can compare it to those of known species and who knows maybe you get a match so she shipped him one of the fragments fedex yeah you want to track it it s kind of important,True,True,good,,,,,,
and im thinking what that is amazing if it is true so they tested a bunch of the fragments and they got the same result for each one however based on the size of the bone that they found it meant that this camel was percent larger than modern day camels so this camel would have been about nine feet tall weighed around a ton yeah natalia had found a giant arctic camel,True,True,good,,,,,,
so this is a story about how we know what we know it is a story about this woman natalia she is a which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff natalia yeah i had someone call me dr dead things and i think she is particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up way above the arctic circle in the remote canadian tundra now one summer day in she was at a dig site called the leaf bed which is less than degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole,False,False,good,,,,,,
it was just lying on the surface and at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood because that is the sort of thing people had found at the leaf bed before prehistoric plant parts but that night back at camp i get out the hand lens im looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesnt quite look like this has tree rings,False,False,good,,,,,,
now im not the first person to tell this story others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change but i love it for a totally different reason for me it is a story about us about how we see the world and about how that changes so i was trained as a historian and ive learned that actually a lot of scientists are historians too they make sense of the past they tell the history of our universe of our planet of life on this planet,False,False,good,,,,,,
we make up stories and we stick with it like the camel in the desert right that is a great story it is totally adapted for that clearly it always lived there but at any moment you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence you could learn some tiny thing that forces you to everything you thought you knew,False,False,good,,,,,,
so here it is huh that is not so good is it there is nothing particularly radical or revolutionary about a patch of grass what starts to get interesting is when we turn it into this now i would like to suggest to you all that gardening is a subversive activity,True,False,bad,,,,,,
think about this food is a form of energy it is what our body runs on but it is also a form of power and when we encourage people to grow some of their own food were encouraging them to take power into their hands power over their diet power over their health and some power over their pocketbooks so i think that is quite subversive because were also necessarily talking about taking that power away from someone else from other actors in society that currently have power over food and health you can think about who those actors might be i also look at gardening as a sort of healthy gateway drug you might say to other forms of food freedom it s not long after you plant a garden that you start to say hey i need to start to learn how to cook,True,True,good,,,,,,
or i might want to look up where my local farmer s market is located in my town now the other thing of course with planting a garden especially a garden in front of a white house and on a sunny south lawn is you never know who you might influence,True,True,good,,,,,,
i understand that she is just in a completely different league there and im not even trying to compete but she is really inspired me to think much more boldly about the role that i want to have in the garden movement and so this is sort of what im aspiring to here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i like this picture i think it sort of captures me well not that i have any divine connections whatsoever but i like my facial expression there because if ive got a worried look on my face it is not simply because ive got pounds of squash over my head but it is because ive got some pretty heavy topics on my mind and i want to share some of those with you right now starting off in the form of a very short video ive produced for you which is my best effort to sum up the history of gastronomy in about seconds,True,True,good,,,,,,
also going to need to grow more food with less time now here im not simply talking about the ticking time bomb that is the global population im talking about the amount of time we all have in order to put a decent meal on the table and that figure there is not something arbitrary that is the average amount of time the american family spends preparing eating and cleaning up after meals per day minutes so somewhere in there were going to need to also fit in growing food alright and i think we do need to do that but that is also going to mean that somewhere along the way something s going to have to give so it sort of leaves us feeling like this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
another important message is this one gardens grow healthy kids and families those happen to be my two youngest sons and they look healthy and they are healthy and i think it has to do with the fact that they grew up in gardens and they know where good food comes from and in fact they know how to grow some of it themselves but in the current economy i think it is key to get this message out that gardens also grow important economic savings for families and you can pretty much take my word on this one because in addition to crunching the vegetables a couple of years ago my wife and i also crunched the numbers and we found out that at the end we had saved well over dollars by growing our own food so you could be asking this question now if gardens grow all of these great things how do we grow more gardens that is in fact the question that my organization kitchen gardens international is both asking and answering and our answer is essentially this one were going to need to leverage the resources and power that we have the gardens and gardeners that we have in order to grow and inspire even more and as i said before you never know who you might inspire,True,True,good,,,,,,
we need a road map and i picked this slide for a reason weve got a bike garden on the left and a map of the netherlands on the right i was in the netherlands early this year and was absolutely amazed by the amount of bikes on the road percent of all trips taken in the netherlands are by bicycle and it is gotten me thinking how do we get that happening in terms of food and gardens how would we get percent of all produce coming from backyard gardens that might sound like a lot because were probably at about two percent at the most right now but if you take into consideration that at the peak of the victory garden movement last century percent of all produce was coming from gardens we can get there again and i think this is a really good start the white house garden is certainly very inspirational that is actually sort of a snapshot of what the garden looked like when it was planted earlier this spring lots of diversity lots of healthy crops however this is not a good representation of our federal agriculture policy,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it was planted by a woman a mother of four and she nearly faced a jail sentence because she planted it in her front yard we still have laws from the century we need to bring our codes up to the realities that we are facing now we need to figure out also new ways of getting people into gardens people who dont have yards i think we also need to set garden free and im happy to say as a mainer that we are leading the way in this area earlier this year a number of maine towns passed local food sovereignty laws that allow town residents to not only grow food where they want to grow it but to also sell it the way they want to sell it and to the people they want to sell it to i think that is an incentive there are a lot of gardeners out there that would be interested in scaling up their production if they could if they had a financial incentive i also think that we need to examine the composition of the movement right now,True,True,good,,,,,,
in fact my plot can only work if i share it with as many people as possible so im going to share it with you now but you have to promise me youre going to share it in turn,False,False,good,,,,,,
over million people right now are affected by it that s three times the population of the united states,False,False,good,,,,,,
what makes this even more challenging is that were going to need to grow all this food with less and when i say less i mean a number of things less oil for example most reputable geologists believe that weve already reached peak oil production in the world now you might not think in terms of oil and food as being linked but there is a very strong link in fact it takes calories of fossil fuel energy in our highly industrialized food system in order to produce one calorie of food energy well also need to grow more food with less water these three images come from three very different parts of the planet but they all tell the same story of catastrophic drought well also need to grow more food with less farmland,False,False,good,,,,,,
well also need to grow more food with less farmland here the pressures differ from one place to the next in the global south were seeing whereas in the north were seeing suburban sprawl well also have to grow more food with less climate stability and less genetic diversity now this is really important we need our genetic varieties because theyre a sort of insurance policy against climate change we heard earlier today not putting all of our eggs in one basket well we shouldnt be doing the same with our tomatoes either,False,False,good,,,,,,
the truth is something quite different now what is become even more troublesome of late is that even the foods that ought to be healthy arent always so and were starting to lose confidence in our food system i think the bigger it becomes and the more complex it becomes and weve seen this time and time again this is an image from the latest e coli outbreak in this case it was in europe and we think it was started with bean sprouts of all things,False,False,good,,,,,,
so we have this sort of shopper s dilemma right now we have all of these different foods foods in the average big box grocery store but we have less confidence in those foods and we have less confidence in the actors that are putting those foods on the shelves i think we need to redefine what good food is this is an interesting image from berlin germany where somebody started planting shopping carts and leaving them around those are potatoes by the way but in addition to redefining what good food is i think we need to redefine our living spaces instead of seeing this as a yard we need to think of it more as like a full service,False,False,good,,,,,,
in addition to redefining what good food is i think we need to redefine our living spaces instead of seeing this as a yard we need to think of it more as like a full service that is in fact my yard and that is how i look at it that is what we transformed our yard into and i think a really key message is this one gardens grow good food and when i say good food i mean a number of different things i mean food that is safe food that is healthy food that is absolutely gorgeous and delicious another important message is this one gardens grow healthy kids and families those happen to be my two youngest sons and they look healthy and they are healthy and i think it has to do with the fact that they grew up in gardens and they know where good food comes from and in fact they know how to grow some of it themselves,False,False,good,,,,,,
but there is still so much more that needs to be done and i think this slide sort of captures where we need to go we need a road map and i picked this slide for a reason,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think one place we could start is we could look at the tax code were already using the tax code to encourage green transport and green shelter,False,False,good,,,,,,
but we can do it the technology is certainly there in addition to that i think we need another type of infrastructure it would be good if we could all get together i think if weve learned anything through the ted experience it is that there is power when we bring people together and i think we need to bring people together at the local level as well and i think we can take some inspiration from a previous movement which was the grange movement a rural movement which brought farmers together in a single building to meet and to recreate and learn how to become better farmers,False,False,good,,,,,,
jack geiger who had written to congratulate me on health leads and to share as he said a bit of historical context in dr geiger founded one of the first two community health centers in this country in a brutally poor area in the mississippi delta and so many of his patients came in presenting with malnutrition that be began prescribing food for them and they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket which would fill them and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic and when the office of economic opportunity in washington d c which was funding clinic found out about this they were furious and they sent this bureaucrat down to tell geiger that he was expected to use their dollars for medical care to which geiger famously and logically responded the last time i checked my textbooks the specific therapy for malnutrition was food,True,True,good,,,,,,
showed up the first day ready to make coffee and photocopies but was paired with this righteous deeply inspired attorney named jeff purcell who thrust me onto the front lines from the very first day and over the course of nine months i had the chance to have dozens of conversations with low income families in boston who would come in presenting with housing issues but always had an underlying health issue so i had a client who came in about to be evicted because he hasnt paid his rent but he hasnt paid his rent of course because he is paying for his medication and just cant afford both we had moms who would come in daughter has asthma wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning,False,False,good,,,,,,
smack can mean kiss as in air kisses as in lip smacking but that can lead to smack as in hit as in domestic abuse because sexual attraction can seem threatening the red that means fertility can also mean poison oleander is poisonous and usages like smack for kiss or hit can help us see how our assumptions can make us believe we are bad either because sex is sinful or because we tolerate so much sexism we let guys tell women what to do the poem reacts to old lipstick ads and its edginess about statement its reversals and halts have everything to do with resisting the language of ads that want to tell us so easily what to want what to do what to think that resistance is a lot of the point of the poem which shows me armantrout shows me what it is like to hear grave threats and mortal dishonesty in the language of everyday life and once she is done that i think she can show other people women and men what it is like to feel that way and say to other people women and men who feel so alienated or so threatened that theyre not alone now how do i know that im right about this somewhat confusing poem well in this case i emailed the poet a draft of my talk and she said yeah yeah that is about it yeah,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i read poetry all the time and write about it frequently and take poems apart to see how they work because im a word person i understand the world best most fully in words rather than say pictures or numbers and when i have a new experience or a new feeling im a little frustrated until i can try to put it into words i think ive always been that way i devoured science fiction as a child i still do and i found poems by andrew marvell and matthew arnold and emily dickinson and william butler yeats because they were quoted in science fiction and i loved their sounds and i went on to read about rima and medial and and all that other technical stuff that you care about if you already care about poems because poems already made me happier and sadder and more alive,False,False,good,,,,,,
update you will recall i introduced you guys to the tracker it is like a water dowsing device it is just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around and you walk around and it points to things like if youre looking for marijuana in students lockers itll point right to somebody oh sorry,True,True,good,,,,,,
pretty sexy feet i must say maybe a little and of course the ambiguous figures that seem to flip flop back and forth it turns out what youre thinking about a lot influences what you tend to see and you see the lamp here i know because the lights on here of course thanks to the environmentalist movement were all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals so what you see in this particular ambiguous figure is of course the dolphins right you see a dolphin here and there is a dolphin and there is a dolphin that s a dolphin tail there guys,True,True,good,,,,,,
so what i want to talk about today is belief i want to believe and you do too and in fact i think my thesis here is that belief is the natural state of things it is the default option we just believe we believe all sorts of things belief is natural disbelief skepticism science is not natural it s more difficult,False,False,good,,,,,,
we find patterns we make those connections whether it is dog here associating the sound of the bell with the food and then he to the sound of the bell or whether it is a rat in which he is having an association between his behavior and a reward for it and therefore he repeats the behavior in fact what skinner discovered is that if you put a pigeon in a box like this and he has to press one of these two keys and he tries to figure out what the pattern is and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there if you just randomly assign rewards such that there is no pattern they will figure out any kind of pattern and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward they repeat that particular pattern sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise once clockwise and peck the key twice and that is called superstition and that im afraid we will always have with us i call this process that is the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise when we do this process we make two types of errors a type i error or false positive is believing a pattern is real when it is not our second type of error is a false negative,False,False,good,,,,,,
com where you can actually buy collections of sheep you cant pick individual sheep but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity and juxtaposed against this grid you see actually by rolling over each individual one the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process i think there is something really interesting to watching people as they go through this creative toil something we can all relate to this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing i think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity versus this massive distributed grid kind of amazing what some people did so here s a few statistics from the project approximate collection rate of sheep per hour which would make a working wage of cents per hour there were rejected sheep that didnt meet sheep like criteria and were thrown out of the flock,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication and there were people that contributed to the project or were unique ip addresses so about how many people contributed but only one of them out of the said this,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so im going to show you a few of the projects that ive been working on over the last couple years that reflect on our lives and our systems,False,False,good,,,,,,
you can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer see again the diversity and you can scroll around and see some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have this is up the east coast you can see some of the chaos that is happening in new york with the air traffic controllers having to deal with all those major airports next to each other so zooming back out real quick we see again the u s you get florida down in the right hand corner moving across to the west coast you see san francisco and los angeles big low traffic zones across nevada and arizona,False,False,good,,,,,,
we turned to the tech sector there is been quite a lot of innovations there just to name one the internet we hoped it could produce growth and indeed it changed our lives it made big waves in the media the service the entertainment spaces but it hasnt done much for productivity actually what is surprising is that productivity is on the decline despite all of those innovation efforts imagine that sitting at work through watching videos on has made us less productive weird,True,False,bad,,,,,,
growth is fading away and it is a big deal our global economy stops growing and it is not new growth has actually declined for the last years if we continue like this we need to learn how to live in a world with no growth in the next decade this is scary because when the economy doesnt grow our children dont get better lives,False,False,good,,,,,,
she was the kind of teacher that was like victor im here for you whenever youre ready,True,False,bad,,,,,,
with ms help i ended up returning to school i even finished my credits on time and graduated with my class but ms russ said to me right before graduation victor im so proud of you i knew you could do it now it is time to go to college,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so we went out to test these ideas in the community of watts in la with young people that had been pushed out of school william was one of them william was the kind of kid that had been given every label he had dropped out he was a gang member a criminal and when we met him he was very resistant but i remember what ms russ used to say hey im here for you whenever youre ready,True,True,good,,,,,,
i wasnt ready but she understood one basic principle about young people like me were like oysters were only going to open up when were ready and if youre not there when were ready were going to clam back up ms russ was there for me she was culturally relevant she respected my community my people my family,False,False,good,,,,,,
russ was there for me she was culturally relevant she respected my community my people my family i told her a story about my uncle ruben he would take me to work with him because i was broke and he knew i needed some money he collected glass bottles for a living four in the morning on a school day wed throw the glass bottles in the back of his van and the bottles would break and my hands and arms would start to bleed and my tennis shoes and pants would get all bloody and i was terrified and in pain and i would stop working and my uncle he would look me in the eyes and he would say to me vida,False,False,good,,,,,,
the first let us get rid of our deficit perspective in education these people come from a culture of violence a culture of poverty these people are at risk these people are truant,False,False,good,,,,,,
about four years ago i took a team of students down to haiti and we worked with peace corps volunteers there this is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked and the idea was that you could take waste paper you could compress it and make that could be used for fuel but this device was very slow so our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes they were able to triple the throughput of this device so you could imagine they were very excited about it and they took the back to mit so that they could test them and one of the things that they found was they didnt burn so it was a little discouraging to the students,True,True,good,,,,,,
one of the really exciting things though is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month and i think it is the coolest thing and it is even lower tech than what you just saw if you can imagine such a thing here it is so what is this this is turned into charcoal and the beauty of this is that you dont need to form it comes ready made this is my laptop right here and actually like nick i brought samples,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so we can pass these around theyre fully functional field tested ready to roll out,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology is that the technology transfer is so pared to the charcoal where we have to teach people how to form it into and you have the extra step of cooking the binder this comes pre and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life,True,True,good,,,,,,
what is the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale do you need to find entrepreneurs or venture capitalists or what do you need to take what youve got and get it to scale i think it is large numbers of people moving it forward it is a difficult thing it is a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income so you cant use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward and were a pretty small staff which is me,True,False,bad,,,,,,
a couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths that is directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil so the rains come they go down the rivers and the flooding happens,False,False,good,,,,,,
now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this people need to cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it it is not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage they know perfectly well but they have no other choice fossil fuels are not available and solar energy doesnt cook the way that they like their food prepared and so this is what they do youll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it so not surprisingly there is a lot of effort that is been done to look at alternative cooking fuels,False,False,good,,,,,,
what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level you see these all over haiti as well,False,False,good,,,,,,
we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level you see these all over haiti as well theyre small scale sugar mills and the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the is called it has no other use it has no nutritional value so they dont feed it to the animals it just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with something like charcoal so over the next couple of years students and i worked to develop a process,False,False,good,,,,,,
so im actually an instructor at mit as well as and these are the that we made now im going to take you to a different continent this is india and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in india it s cow dung,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is india and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in india it is cow dung and more than in haiti this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel kids and women are especially affected by it because theyre the ones who are around the cooking fires so we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal making technology there well unfortunately they didnt have and they didnt have but that didnt stop us what we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass and there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area and what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel,False,False,good,,,,,,
truth be told i have never found a role model i could truly identify with my mother s generation wasnt into professional leadership there were some encouraging men along the way but none knew the demands and pressures i was facing pressures that got particularly acute when i had my own two beautiful children and although western women love to give us poor oppressed arab women advice they live different lives with different constraints so arab women of my generation have had to become our own role models we have had to juggle more than arab men and we have had to face more cultural rigidity than western women as a result i would like to think that we poor oppressed women actually have some useful certainly hard earned lessons to share lessons that might turn out useful for anyone wishing to thrive in the modern world here are three of mine convert their into your fuel,True,True,good,,,,,,

there is this word that everybody is touting as the key to success resilience well what exactly is resilience and how do you develop it i believe resilience is simply the ability to transform shit into fuel in my previous job well before my current firm i was working with a man we will call john i had teamed up with john and was working hard hoping he would notice how great i was and that he would come to support my case to make partner at the firm,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is sort of your classic idea of a heat ray it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things anybody who is hit with this feels a sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go i want to get out of the way and they think this will be really useful in places where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place we can do that with these sorts of things so there is a whole range of different nonlethal weapons we could give military personnel and there is a whole range of situations where theyre looking at them and saying these things would be really useful but as i said the military and the police are very different,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and you cant actually find them very easily for individual australian states i could only find these this is from an australian institute of criminology report you can see in the fine print at the top police shooting deaths means not just people shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but these are the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where queensland said yes this is where were going to give all police officers across the entire state access to spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike a few years before but that wasnt actually queensland anyone know where that was wasnt port arthur no victoria yes correct that spike was all victoria,True,False,bad,,,,,,
next two years were the years they studied anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how theyve introduced this the number of times police in queensland used spray in that period hundreds one three a thousand is getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting im going to go out on a limb here and say that if queensland police didnt have spray they wouldnt have shot people in those two years,True,True,good,,,,,,
i checked the reports on this one i looked at it i was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed,True,False,bad,,,,,,
there is a bunch of reasons why we send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if australia had to send people tomorrow to west papua for example we dont have police officers hanging around that could go tomorrow and we do have soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military theyre there theyre available and heck theyre used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they arent trained the same way police officers are and theyre certainly not equipped the way police officers are so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these issues one particular thing that is come up that i am especially interested in is the question of whether when were sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the nonlethal weapons that police have since theyre doing some of the same jobs maybe they should have some of those things,False,False,good,,,,,,
there is a range of places youd think those things would be really useful for example when youve got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel are unsure if this person s hostile or not say this person approaching here and they say is this a suicide bomber or not is something hidden under their clothes what is going to happen they dont know if the person is hostile or not if the person doesnt follow directions they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either yes we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didnt understand what was going on,False,False,good,,,,,,
if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel are unsure if this person s hostile or not say this person approaching here and they say is this a suicide bomber or not is something hidden under their clothes what is going to happen they dont know if the person is hostile or not if the person doesnt follow directions they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either yes we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didnt understand what was going on so if they had nonlethal weapons then they would say we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasnt hostile at least we havent killed them another situation this photo is from one of the missions in the balkans in the late this situation is a little bit different where maybe they know someone is hostile theyve got someone shooting at them or doing something else that is clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there is a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt itd be collateral damage that the military often doesnt want to talk about so again theyd say with access to nonlethal weapons if weve got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else at least were not going to kill them,False,False,good,,,,,,
started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way police use nonlethal weapons when theyre introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being australian i started looking at stuff in australia knowing from my own experience of various times when nonlethal weapons have been introduced in australia one of the things i particularly looked at was the use of spray spray pepper spray by australian police and seeing what had happened when that had been introduced and those sorts of issues and one study that i found a particularly interesting one was in queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and i went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced spray in queensland they were really explicit the police minister s and a heap of public statements were made about it,False,False,good,,,,,,

so i said how on earth do you know all this and they said something very interesting to me in an irritated voice they said youve given us a machine that works only in english so we had to teach ourselves english in order to use it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i started publishing i published everywhere i wrote down and measured everything and i said in nine months a group of children left alone with a computer in any language will reach the same standard as an office secretary in the west id seen it happen over and over and over again but i was curious to know what else would they do if they could do this much i started experimenting with other subjects among them for example pronunciation there is one community of children in southern india whose english pronunciation is really bad and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs i gave them a speech engine in a computer and i said keep talking into it until it types what you say,True,True,good,,,,,,
important but it is all in english so they said how can we understand such big english words and diagrams and chemistry so by now i had developed a new pedagogical method so i applied that i said i havent the foggiest idea,True,True,good,,,,,,
why did they create a system like that because it was needed there was an age in the age of empires when you needed those people who can survive under threat when youre standing in a trench all alone if you could have survived youre okay youve passed if you didnt you failed but the age of empires is gone what happens to creativity in our age we need to shift that balance back from threat to pleasure i came back to england looking for british grandmothers i put out notices in papers saying if you are a british grandmother if you have broadband and a web camera can you give me one hour of your time per week for free i got in the first two weeks i know more british grandmothers than anyone in the universe,True,True,good,,,,,,

it came from about years ago and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet the british empire imagine trying to run the show trying to run the entire planet without computers without telephones with data handwritten on pieces of paper and traveling by ships but the victorians actually did it what they did was amazing they created a global computer made up of people it is still with us today it is called the bureaucratic administrative machine in order to have that machine running you need lots and lots of people they made another machine to produce those people the school,False,False,good,,,,,,

for those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor the two do communicate with one another through the corpus which is made up of some million fibers but other than that the two are completely separate because they process information differently each of our think about different things they care about different things and dare i say they have very different personalities excuse me thank you it is been a joy it has been,True,False,bad,,,,,,

our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment it is all about right here right now our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns through the movement of our bodies information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like i am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right as one human family,False,False,good,,,,,,
our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details and more details about those details it then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past weve ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities and our left hemisphere thinks in language it is that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world it is that little voice that says to me hey youve got to remember to pick up bananas on your way home i need them in the morning it is that calculating intelligence that reminds me when i have to do my laundry but perhaps most important it is that little voice that says to me i am i am,False,False,good,,,,,,
then like any other consumer product you would demand to know what youre paying for when you buy medicines you get a list of side effects when you buy a higher educational product you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choose make informed choices when you buy a car it tells you how many miles per gallon to expect who knows what to expect from a degree say in canadian studies there is such a thing by the way what if there was an app for that one that linked up the cost of a major to the expected income let us call it income based tuition or one of you make this,True,True,good,,,,,,

people are saying that it is moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood and when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that were starting to see what you find is in fact even more access suffused into spaces some of it is transportation access this is a map that shows me in this case how far i can get from my home in minutes using public transportation some of it is about walking it is not all perfect yet this is walking maps i asked how to do the greater ridgeway and it told me to go via guernsey it did tell me that this maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths though,True,False,bad,,,,,,
climate change is already a heavy topic and it is getting heavier because were understanding that we need to do more than we are were understanding in fact that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions that is to put it mildly not what is on the table now and it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face and when we have overwhelming problems in front of us we tend to seek simple answers and i think this is what weve done with climate change,False,False,good,,,,,,
solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt porous asphalt a material that we use now in most of the highways in the netherlands it has pores and water can just rain through it so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides and you have a road that is easy to drive on so no splash water anymore also the noise will disappear in these pores because it is very hollow all the noise will disappear so it is a very silent road it also has disadvantages of course and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur what is raveling you see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off first you get one stone then several more and more and more and more and more and then they well i will not do that,True,True,good,,,,,,
that this is a very nice road it is made of asphalt and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on but not always especially not on these days as today when it is raining a lot then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt and especially if you then ride with your bicycle and pass these cars then that is not very nice also asphalt can create a lot of noise it s a noisy material and if we produce roads like in the netherlands very close to cities then we would like a silent road,False,False,good,,,,,,

forced evictions are incredibly violent and of course unconstitutional and yet they happen so often in so many of our cities because the first thing we are taught to forget about poor people is that they are people we believe that a home is a thing a person absolutely has a right to unless the person is poor and the home is built a certain way in a certain neighborhood but there is no single definition of the word home after all what is a slum besides an organic response to acute housing deficits and income inequality and what is a shanty if not a person making a home for themselves against all odds slums are an imperfect housing solution but they are also prime examples of the innovation adaptability and resilience at the foundation and the heart of every functional city you dont need to be the new dubai when youre already lagos we have our own identity our own rhythm and as anyone who knows lagos can tell you poor are very often the source of the city s character without its poor lagos would not be known for its music or its endless energy or even the fact that you can buy an ice cold drink or a puppy through your car window,True,True,good,,,,,,

well the classical approach consists of applying intervention that would promote the growth of the severed fiber to the original target and while this certainly remained the key for a cure this seemed extraordinarily complicated to me to reach clinical fruition rapidly it was obvious i had to think about the problem differently it turned out that more than years of research on spinal cord physiology starting with the nobel prize had shown that the spinal cord below most injuries contained all the necessary and sufficient neural networks to coordinate locomotion but because input from the brain is interrupted they are in a state like kind of dormant my idea we awaken this network and at the time i was a post doctoral fellow in los angeles after completing my ph d in france where independent thinking is not necessarily promoted,True,False,bad,,,,,,

so if you look in the dictionaries and if you think about it one very natural definition of religion is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings as i say this is in many dictionaries but youll also find it actually in the work of sir edward who was the first professor of anthropology at oxford one of the first modern anthropologists in his book on primitive culture he says the heart of religion is what he called animism that is the belief in spiritual agency belief in spirits the first problem for that definition is from a recent novel by paul beatty called tuff there is a guy talking to a rabbi the rabbi says he doesnt believe in god the guy says youre a rabbi how can you not believe in god and the reply is it is what is so great about being jewish you dont have to believe in a god per se just in being jewish,True,False,bad,,,,,,
here s another argument against this view a friend of mine an indian friend of mine went to his grandfather when he was very young a child and said to him i want to talk to you about religion and his grandfather said youre too young come back when youre a teenager so he came back when he was a teenager and he said to his grandfather it may be a bit late now because ive discovered that i dont believe in the gods and his grandfather who was a wise man said oh so you belong to the atheist branch of the hindu tradition,True,True,good,,,,,,
now remarks of this sort on the negative and the positive side are very old i have one in my pocket here from the first century by the author of on the nature of things who said i should have been able to learn that by heart which is that is how much religion is able to persuade people to do evil and he was talking about the fact of agamemnon s decision to place his daughter on an altar of sacrifice in order to preserve the prospects of his army so there have been these long debates over the centuries in that case actually we can say over the millennia about religion people have talked about it a lot and theyve said good and bad and indifferent things about it what i want to persuade you of today is of a very simple claim which is that these debates are in a certain sense preposterous because there is no such thing as religion about which to make these claims,False,False,good,,,,,,
what i want to persuade you of today is of a very simple claim which is that these debates are in a certain sense preposterous because there is no such thing as religion about which to make these claims there isnt a thing called religion and so it cant be good or bad it cant even be indifferent and if you think about claims about the of things one obvious way to try and establish the of a purported thing would be to offer a definition of that thing and then to see whether anything satisfied it im going to start out on that little to begin with so if you look in the dictionaries and if you think about it one very natural definition of religion is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings as i say this is in many dictionaries but youll also find it actually in the work of sir edward who was the first professor of anthropology at oxford one of the first modern anthropologists in his book on primitive culture he says the heart of religion is what he called animism that is the belief in spiritual agency belief in spirits,False,False,good,,,,,,

of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods you know were often told that we live in very materialistic times that were all greedy people i dont think we are particularly materialistic i think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods it is not the material goods we want it is the rewards we want it is a new way of looking at luxury goods the next time you see somebody driving a ferrari dont think this is somebody who is greedy think this is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love,True,True,good,,,,,,
and it is a beautiful idea along with that is a kind of spirit of equality were all basically equal there are no strictly defined hierarchies there is one really big problem with this and that problem is envy envy it is a real taboo to mention envy but if there is one dominant emotion in modern society that is envy and it is linked to the spirit of equality let me explain i think it would be very unusual for anyone here or anyone watching to be envious of the queen of england even though she is much richer than any of you are and she is got a very large house the reason why we dont envy her is because she is too weird,True,True,good,,,,,,
closer two people are in age in background in the process of identification the more there is a danger of envy which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with the problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school everybody s wearing jeans everybody s the same and yet theyre not so there is a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality which can make for a very stressful situation it is probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as bill gates as it was unlikely in the century that you would accede to the ranks of the french aristocracy but the point is it doesnt feel that way it s made to feel by magazines and other media outlets that if youve got energy a few bright ideas about technology a garage you too could start a major thing,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if you open the newspaper any day of the week it is full of people whove messed up their lives theyve slept with the wrong person taken the wrong substance passed the wrong piece of legislation whatever it is and then are fit for ridicule in other words they have failed and they are described as losers now is there any alternative to this i think the western tradition shows us one glorious alternative which is tragedy tragic art as it developed in the theaters of ancient greece in the fifth century b c was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail and also according them a level of sympathy which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them a few years ago i was thinking about this and i went to the sunday sport a tabloid newspaper i dont recommend you start reading if youre not familiar with it already,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of western art i wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a saturday afternoon i mentioned othello theyd not heard of it but were fascinated,True,True,good,,,,,,

they normally happen these career crises often actually on a sunday evening just as the sun is starting to set and the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life starts to diverge so painfully that i normally end up weeping into a pillow im mentioning all this im mentioning all this because i think this is not merely a personal problem you may think im wrong in this but i think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises by moments when what we thought we knew about our lives about our careers comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality it is perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living it is perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm to be free of career anxiety i want to look now if i may at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers why we might be victims of these career crises as were weeping softly into our pillows,False,False,good,,,,,,
there are other reasons why it is perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before one of these and it is paradoxical because it is linked to something that is rather nice is the hope we all have for our careers never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan were told from many sources that anyone can achieve anything weve done away with the caste system we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please and it is a beautiful idea,False,False,good,,,,,,
everybody all politicians on left and right agree that meritocracy is a great thing and we should all be trying to make our societies really really in other words what is a society a society is one in which if youve got talent and energy and skill you will get to the top nothing should hold you back it is a beautiful idea the problem is if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top get to the top youll also by implication and in a far more nasty way believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there in other words your position in life comes to seem not accidental but merited and deserved and that makes failure seem much more crushing you know in the middle ages in england when you met a very poor person that person would be described as an unfortunate literally somebody who had not been blessed by fortune an unfortunate nowadays particularly in the united states if you meet someone at the bottom of society they may be described as a loser,False,False,good,,,,,,
you know in the middle ages in england when you met a very poor person that person would be described as an unfortunate literally somebody who had not been blessed by fortune an unfortunate nowadays particularly in the united states if you meet someone at the bottom of society they may be described as a loser there is a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser and that shows years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives it is no longer the gods it is us were in the driving seat that is exhilarating if youre doing well and very crushing if youre not it leads in the worst cases in the analysis of a sociologist like emil durkheim it leads to increased rates of suicide there are more suicides in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world and some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally they own their success but they also own their failure,False,False,good,,,,,,
there any relief from some of these pressures that ive been outlining i think there is i just want to turn to a few of them let us take meritocracy this idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to i think it is a crazy idea completely crazy i will support any politician of left and right with any halfway decent idea i am a in that sense but i think it is insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely it is an impossible dream,False,False,good,,,,,,
in a way if you like at one end of the spectrum of sympathy youve got the tabloid newspaper at the other end of the spectrum youve got tragedy and tragic art and i suppose im arguing that we should learn a little bit about what is happening in tragic art it would be insane to call hamlet a loser he is not a loser though he has lost,False,False,good,,,,,,
about three seconds ago ive been for about years and when i first started i would sit down with people and say hey let us talk years out and theyd say great and ive been seeing that time horizon get shorter and shorter and shorter so much so that i met with a two months ago and i said we started our initial conversation he goes i love what you do i want to talk about the next six months,True,False,bad,,,,,,
these are scale problems the issue though is we cant solve them using the mental models that we use right now to try and solve these problems yes a lot of great technical work is being done but there is a problem that we need to solve for a before if we want to really move the needle on those big problems short right there is no marches there is no bracelets there is no petitions that you can sign to be against short i tried to put one up and no one signed it was weird,True,True,good,,,,,,
now the reality is for a lot of these problems there are some technical fixes a lot of them i call these technical fixes sandbag strategies so you know there is a storm coming the levee is broken no one s put any money into it you surround your home with sandbags and guess what it works storm goes away the water level goes down you get rid of the sandbags and you do this storm after storm after storm and here s the insidious thing a sandbag strategy can get you reelected a sandbag strategy can help you make your quarterly numbers now if we want to move forward into a different future than the one we have right now because i dont think weve hit is not peak civilization,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but here s a problem with these issues they stack up on top of us because the only way we know how to do something good in the world is if we do it between our birth and our death that is what were programmed to do if you go to the self help section in any bookstore it is all about you which is great unless youre dealing with some of these major issues and so with thinking which is really kind of ethics youre able to expand how you think about these problems what is your role in helping to solve them now this isnt something that just has to be done at the security council chamber it is something that you can do in a very kind of personal way so every once in a while if im lucky my wife and i like to go out to dinner and we have three children under the age of seven so you can imagine it is a very peaceful quiet meal,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so we sit down and literally all i want to do is just eat and chill and my kids have a completely and totally different idea of what were going to be doing and so my first idea is my sandbag strategy right it is to go into my pocket and take out the and give them frozen or some other bestselling game thing and then i stop and i have to kind of put on this thinking cap i dont do this in the restaurant because it would be bizarre but i have to i did it once and that is how i learned it was bizarre,True,False,bad,,,,,,
you dont have to give it to me but think in your head and what youre probably going to see is the dominant cultural lens that dominates our thinking about the future right now technology so when we think about the problems we always put it through a technological lens a tech a techno utopia and there is nothing wrong with that but it is something that we have to really think deeply about if were going to move on these major issues because it wasnt always like this right the ancients had their way of thinking about what the future was the church definitely had their idea of what the future could be and you could actually pay your way into that future right and luckily for humanity we got the scientific revolution from there we got the technology but what has happened and by the way this is not a critique i love technology everything in my house talks back to me from my children to my speakers to everything,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we pretty much have eradicated global polio we did the transcontinental railroad the marshall plan,False,False,good,,,,,,
we did the panama canal we pretty much have eradicated global polio we did the transcontinental railroad the marshall plan and it is not just big physical infrastructure problems and issues women s suffrage the right to vote but in our short time where everything seems to happen right now and we can only think out past the next tweet or timeline post we get hyper reactionary so what do we do we take people who are fleeing their war torn country and we go after them we take low level drug offenders and we put them away for life and then we build without even thinking about how people are going to get between them and their job,False,False,good,,,,,,
first thinking i love the philosophers plato socrates i was raised on them but they all did one thing that didnt actually seem like a big deal until i really started kind of looking into this and they all took as a unit of measure for their entire reality of what it meant to be virtuous and good the single lifespan from birth to death but here s a problem with these issues they stack up on top of us because the only way we know how to do something good in the world is if we do it between our birth and our death that is what were programmed to do if you go to the self help section in any bookstore it is all about you,False,False,good,,,,,,
what im saying is we have to rethink our base assumption about only looking at the future in one way only looking at it through the dominant lens because our problems are so big and so vast that we need to open ourselves up,False,False,good,,,,,,
that is why i do everything in my power not to talk about the future i talk about futures it opens the conversation again so when youre sitting and thinking about how do we move forward on this major issue it could be at home it could be at work it could be again on the global stage dont cut yourself off from thinking about something beyond technology as a fix because were more concerned about technological evolution right now than we are about moral evolution and unless we fix for that were not going to be able to get out of short and get to where we want to be the final telos thinking this comes from the greek root,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is a verb it requires action,False,False,good,,,,,,
designing a game we speak to physical therapists at first to understand what movement patients need to do we then make that a video game to give patients simple motivating objectives to follow but the software is very and physical therapists can also create their own exercises using the software my physical therapist recorded herself performing a shoulder abduction which is one of the movements my mom had to do when she had frozen shoulder i can follow my therapist s example on the left side of the screen while on the right i see myself doing the recommended movement i feel more engaged and confident as im exercising alongside my therapist with the exercises my therapist thinks are best for me this basically extends the application for physical therapists to create whatever exercises they think are best this is an auction house game for preventing falls designed to strengthen muscles and improve balance as a patient i need to do sit and stand movements and when i stand up i bid for the items i want to buy,True,False,bad,,,,,,

my favorite concept from the in the pentagon the theory of anti access area denial asymmetrical strategies why do we call it that because it is got all those a s lined up i guess this is gobbledygook for if the united states fights somebody were going to be huge theyre going to be small and if they try to fight us in the traditional straight up manner were going to kick their ass which is why people dont try to do that any more i met the last air force general who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat he is now a one star general that is how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours so that overmatched capability creates problems catastrophic successes the white house calls them,True,False,bad,,,,,,

the rule is going to be this that force is the force that never comes home does most of your work you break out that leviathan force only every so often but here s the promise you make to the american public to your own people to the world you break out that leviathan force you promise you guarantee that youre going to mount one hell of a immediately follow on effort dont plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace other differences leviathan traditional partners they all look like the brits and their former colonies,True,True,good,,,,,,
the rest wider array of partners international organizations non governmental organizations private voluntary organizations contractors youre not going to get away from that leviathan force it is all about joint operations between the military services were done with that what we need to do is inter agency operations which frankly rice was in charge of and im amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed i call the leviathan force your dad s military i like them young male unmarried slightly pissed off,True,True,good,,,,,,

i was three months pregnant with twins when my husband ross and i went to my second sonogram i was years old at the time and i knew that that meant we had a higher risk of having a child with a birth defect so ross and i researched the standard birth defects and we felt reasonably prepared well nothing would have prepared us for the bizarre diagnosis that we were about to face the doctor explained that one of our twins thomas had a fatal birth defect called anencephaly this means that his brain was not formed correctly because part of his skull was missing,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i asked my nurse about organ eye and tissue donation she connected with our local organ procurement organization the washington regional transplant community explained to me that thomas would probably be too small at birth to donate for transplant and i was shocked i didnt even know you could be rejected for that but they said that he would be a good candidate to donate for research this helped me see thomas in a new light as opposed to just a victim of a disease i started to see him as a possible key to unlock a medical mystery on march the twins were born and they were both born alive,False,False,good,,,,,,
whenever i get to travel for work i try to find out where my drinking water comes from and where my poop and pee go,True,True,good,,,,,,

our rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant too much rain overflows into the river and portland is not alone here forty percent of municipalities self report dumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways the other bummer going on here with our status quo is that half of all of your poop and pee is going to fertilize farmland the other half is being incinerated or land filled and that is a bummer to me because there are amazing nutrients in your daily doody it is comparable to pig manure were theyre think of your poo and pee as a health for a tree,True,True,good,,,,,,
the other bummer going on here is that were quickly moving all the drugs we take into our waterways the average wastewater treatment plant can remove maybe half of the drugs that come in the other half goes right out the other side consider what a cocktail of pharmaceuticals hormones steroids does to a fish to a dog to a child but this isnt just some problem that we need to contain if we flip this around we can create a resource that can solve so many of our other problems and i want to get you comfortable with this idea so imagine the things im going to show you these technologies and this attitude that says were going to reuse this let s design to make it beautiful as advanced potty training,True,True,good,,,,,,
here s a great example where the integrated water management approach was the cheapest this is three high rise residential buildings in downtown portland and theyre not flushing to the sewer system how well their wash water is getting reused to flush toilets cool mechanical systems water the landscape and then once the building has thoroughly used everything aka in it it is treated to highest standard right on site by plants and bacteria and then infiltrated into the groundwater right below and all that was cheaper than updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure so that is the last reason we should get really excited about doing things differently we can save a lot of money this was the first permit of its kind in oregon brave and open minded people sat down and felt comfortable saying yeah that shit makes sense,True,True,good,,,,,,
so even though theyre in a desert they get their own personal oasis this approach is called integrated water management or holistic or closed loop,False,False,good,,,,,,

were kind of uncomfortable talking about sanitation that is why ive gotten called the poo princess so much the second reason is we think the problem is solved here in the us but not so here in the us we still get sick from drinking shit in our sewage water seven million people get sick every year die annually and were not taking a holistic approach to making it better so were not solving it where i live in portland oregon i cant take echo for a swim during the rainy season because we dump raw sewage sometimes into our river our rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant,False,False,good,,,,,,

so around in athens someone named zeno of taught many lectures walking around a painted porch a that later became stoicism and in the greco roman world people used stoicism as a comprehensive system for doing many many things but for our purposes chief among them was training yourself to separate what you can control from what you cannot control and then doing exercises to focus exclusively on the former this decreases emotional reactivity which can be a superpower conversely let us say youre a quarterback you miss a pass you get furious with yourself,False,False,good,,,,,,
she gave this to me to put on my desk for personal health because at the time i was working on my first real business i had no idea what i was doing i was working hour days seven days a week,False,False,good,,,,,,
i had no idea what i was doing i was working hour days seven days a week i was using stimulants to get going i was using depressants to wind down and go to sleep it was a disaster i felt completely trapped i bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers and i did find a quote that made a big difference in my life which was we suffer more often in imagination than in reality by seneca the younger who was a famous stoic writer that took me to his letters which took me to the exercise which means the pre meditation of evils,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i did find a quote that made a big difference in my life which was we suffer more often in imagination than in reality by seneca the younger who was a famous stoic writer that took me to his letters which took me to the exercise which means the pre meditation of evils in simple terms this is visualizing the worst case scenarios in detail that you fear preventing you from taking action so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis my problem was monkey mind super loud very incessant just thinking my way through problems doesnt work i needed to capture my thoughts on paper so i created a written exercise that i called fear setting like goal setting for myself it consists of three pages super simple,False,False,good,,,,,,
thank you i have to tell you im both challenged and excited my excitement is i get a chance to give something back my challenge is the shortest seminar i usually do is hours,True,True,good,,,,,,
you correct me if im wrong the defining factor is never resources it is resourcefulness and what i mean specifically rather than just some phrase is if you have emotion human emotion something that i experienced from you the day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as ive ever experienced and i believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won yeah how easy for me to tell him what he should do,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so the bottom line is maybe it was where to go to work and you met the love of your life there a career decision i know the geniuses i saw here i mean i understand that their decision was to sell their technology what if they made that decision versus to build their own culture how would the world or their lives be different their impact the history of our world is these decisions when a woman stands up and says no i wont go to the back of the bus she didnt just affect her life that decision shaped our culture or someone standing in front of a tank or being in a position like lance armstrong youve got testicular cancer that s pretty tough for any male especially if you ride a bike,True,True,good,,,,,,
and there are seven different beliefs i cant go through them because im done the last piece is emotion one of the parts of the map is like time some people s idea of a long time is years somebody else s is three seconds which is what i have and the last one ive already mentioned that fell to you if youve got a target and a map i cant use because i love macs and they havent made it good for macs yet so if you use how many have made this fatal mistake of using it you use this thing and you dont get there imagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go,True,True,good,,,,,,
and she played the recording for us in the room she was on larry king later and he said youre probably wondering how on earth this could happen to you twice all i can say is this must be god s message to you from now on every day give your all love your all dont let anything ever stop you she finishes and a man stands up and he says im from pakistan im a muslim id love to hold your hand and say im sorry but frankly this is retribution i cant tell you the rest because im out of time,True,True,good,,,,,,
invite you to do by the end of this talk is explore where you are today for two reasons one so that you can contribute more and two that hopefully we can not just understand other people more but appreciate them more and create the kinds of connections that can stop some of the challenges that we face today theyre only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us because it is making us intersect that intersection doesnt always create a view of everybody now understands everybody and everybody appreciates everybody ive had an obsession basically for years what makes the difference in the quality of people s lives what in their performance i got hired to produce the result now ive done it for years,False,False,good,,,,,,
ive had an obsession basically for years what makes the difference in the quality of people s lives what in their performance i got hired to produce the result now ive done it for years i get the phone call when the athlete is burning down on national television and they were ahead by five strokes and now they cant get back on the course ive got to do something right now or nothing matters i get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide ive got to do something in years im very grateful to tell you ive never lost one it doesnt mean i wont some day but i havent yet the reason is an understanding of these human needs when i get those calls about performance that is one thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
those calls about performance that is one thing how do you make a change im also looking to see what is shaping the person s ability to contribute to do something beyond themselves maybe the real question is i look at life and say there is two master lessons one is there is the science of achievement which almost everyone here has mastered amazingly how do you take the invisible and make it visible how do you make your dreams happen your business your contribution to society money whatever your body your family the other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment,False,False,good,,,,,,
question weve got to ask ourselves really is what is it what is it that shapes us we live in a therapy culture most of us dont do that but the culture s a therapy culture the mindset that we are our past and you wouldnt be in this room if you bought that but most of society thinks biography is destiny the past equals the future of course it does if you live there but what we know and what we have to remind ourselves because you can know something intellectually and then not use it not apply it weve got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power,False,False,good,,,,,,
if decisions shape destiny what determines it is three decisions what will you focus on you have to decide what youre going to focus on consciously or unconsciously,False,False,good,,,,,,
in many ways our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility for instance the museum of glass in tacoma washington my home state washington has a program called kids design glass and kids draw their own ideas for glass art the resident artist said they got some of their best ideas from the program because kids dont think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes they just think of good ideas now when you think of glass you might think of colorful designs or maybe italian vases but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of snakes and bacon boys who you can see has meat vision,True,True,good,,,,,,
true story by the way now adults seem to have a restrictive attitude towards kids from every dont do that dont do this in the school handbook to restrictions on school internet use as history points out regimes become oppressive when theyre fearful about keeping control and although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes kids have no or very little say in making the rules when really the attitude should be reciprocal meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population now what is even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids abilities we love challenges but when expectations are low trust me we will sink to them my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister okay so they didnt tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that but my dad did read to us about aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other kids were hearing the wheels on the bus go round and round well we heard that one too but pioneer germ fighters totally rules,True,False,bad,,,,,,
which really bothers me after all take a look at these events imperialism and colonization world wars george w bush ask yourself who is responsible adults,False,False,good,,,,,,
now what have kids done well anne frank touched millions with her powerful account of the holocaust ruby bridges helped to end segregation in the united states and most recently charlie simpson helped to raise pounds for haiti on his little bike so as you can see evidenced by such examples age has absolutely nothing to do with it the traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking,False,False,good,,,,,,
each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments and at each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it is more difficult to create complexity now we as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility and that is the story that we tell in big history but to do it you have do something that may at first sight seem completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe so let us do it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
first a video yes it is a scrambled egg but as you look at it i hope youll begin to feel just slightly uneasy because you may notice that what is actually happening is that the egg is itself and youll now see the yolk and the white have separated and now theyre going to be poured back into the egg,False,False,good,,,,,,
we have been playing guessing games with children all over the world here is an example so in this game we asked children to guess the numbers on the cards and we tell them if they win the game they are going to get a big prize but in the middle of the game we make an excuse and leave the room and before we leave the room we tell them not to peek at the cards of course we have hidden cameras in the room to watch their every move because the desire to win the game is so strong more than percent of children will peek as soon as we leave the room,True,True,good,,,,,,
adult did you peek child no ok if you think child number one is lying please raise your hand and if you think child number two is lying please raise your hand ok so as a matter of fact child number one is telling the truth child number two is lying looks like many of you are terrible detectors of children s lies,True,True,good,,,,,,
sums up very nicely three common beliefs we have about children and lying one children only come to tell lies after entering elementary school two children are poor liars we adults can easily detect their lies and three if children lie at a very young age there must be some character flaws with them and they are going to become pathological liars for life well it turns out all of the three beliefs are wrong,False,False,good,,,,,,
so now let us take a closer look at the younger children why do some but not all young children lie in cooking you need good ingredients to cook good food and good lying requires two key ingredients the first key ingredient is theory of mind or the mind reading ability mind reading is the ability to know that different people have different knowledge about the situation and the ability to differentiate between what i know and what you know,False,False,good,,,,,,
i joined years ago because i wanted female role models and i was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession and what that meant for our image in the media we make up half the population of the world but were just percent of the news subjects quoted in news stories and were just percent of the experts quoted in stories and now with today s technology it is possible to remove women from the picture completely this is a picture of president and his advisors tracking the killing of osama bin laden you can see hillary clinton on the right let us see how the photo ran in an orthodox jewish newspaper based in brooklyn hillary s completely gone,True,True,good,,,,,,
the paper apologized but said it never runs photos of women they might be sexually provocative,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this is an extreme case yes but the fact is women are only percent of the sources in stories on politics and only percent in stories on the economy the news continues to give us a picture where men outnumber women in nearly all occupational categories except two students and homemakers,True,True,good,,,,,,
they tend to sensationalize and they lack context so for her graduate work she did a three part series on the murder of women found buried on west mesa she tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work and she tried to show the challenges that journalists face from external sources their own internal biases and cultural norms and she worked with an editor at national public radio to try to get a story aired nationally she is not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female stories in the news are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts wired magazine november yes the issue was about breast tissue engineering now i know youre all distracted so ill take that off,True,True,good,,,,,,
fast company magazine embraces that idea this is its cover from november the issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology editor robert safian told the poynter institute silicon valley is very white and very male but that is not what fast company thinks the business world will look like in the future so it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving by the way apparently wired took all this to heart this was its issue in april,True,True,good,,,,,,
case in point this march the new york times ran a story by james mckinley about a gang rape of a young girl years old in a small texas town mckinley writes that the community is wondering how could their boys have been drawn into this drawn into this like they were seduced into committing an act of violence and the first person he quotes says these boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives groans laughter you dont hear much about the old victim except that she wore clothes that were a little old for her and she wore makeup the times was deluged with criticism initially it defended itself and said these arent our views this is what we found in our reporting now here s a secret you probably know already your stories are constructed,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is what we found in our reporting now here s a secret you probably know already your stories are constructed as reporters we research we interview we try to give a good picture of reality we also have our own unconscious biases but the times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story the same way i disagree with that so three weeks later the times revisits the story this time it adds another byline to it with erica goode,False,False,good,,,,,,
this time it adds another byline to it with erica goode what emerges is a truly sad horrific tale of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty she was raped numerous times by many men she had been a bright easygoing girl she was maturing quickly physically but her bed was still covered with stuffed animals it is a very different picture perhaps the addition of ms goode is what made this story more complete the global media monitoring project has found that stories by female reporters are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters,False,False,good,,,,,,
here s the thing wired almost never puts women on its cover oh there have been some gimmicky ones pam from the office manga girls a voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds texas state university professor cindy royal wondered in her how are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles in technology reading wired chris anderson the editor of wired defended his choice and said there arent enough women prominent women in technology to sell a cover to sell an issue,False,False,good,,,,,,
the author of the hidden brain how our unconscious minds elect presidents control markets wage wars and save our lives he told the former ombudsman at national public radio who was doing a report on how women fare in npr coverage unconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives it is really difficult to disentangle those strands but he did have one suggestion he used to work for two editors who said every story had to have at least one female source he balked at first but said he eventually followed the directive happily because his stories got better and his job got easier now i dont know if one of the editors was a woman but that can make the biggest difference the dallas morning news won a pulitzer prize in for a series it did on women around the world but one of the reporters told me she is convinced it never would have happened if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor and they would not have gotten some of those stories without female reporters and editors on the ground particularly one on female genital mutilation men would just not be allowed into those situations this is an important point to consider because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries where the treatment of women is an issue such as afghanistan,False,False,good,,,,,,
i was told to come here and tell you all stories but what id like to do is instead tell you why im suspicious of stories why stories make me nervous in fact the more inspired a story makes me feel very often the more nervous i get,True,False,bad,,,,,,
they take a lot of information and they leave some of it out and they keep some of it in but the thing about this filter is that it always leaves the same things in youre always left with the same few simple stories there is the old saying that just about every story can be summed up as a stranger came to town there is a book by christopher booker where he claims there are really just seven types of stories there is monster rags to riches quest voyage and return comedy tragedy rebirth you dont have to agree with that list exactly but the point is this if you think in terms of stories youre telling yourself the same things over and over again there was a study done we asked some people people were asked to describe their lives when asked to describe their lives what is interesting is how few people said mess,True,True,good,,,,,,
mess can be liberating mess can be empowering mess can be a way of drawing upon multiple strengths but what people wanted to say was my life is a journey wanted to turn his or her life into a story said my life is a battle again that is a kind of story said my life is a novel said my life is a play i dont think anyone said my life is a reality tv show,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that we got tough with the nazis was a good thing but this is again a story we fall back upon all too readily all too quickly when we dont really know why something happened we blame someone and we say we need to get tough with them as if it had never occurred to your predecessor this idea of getting tough i view it usually as a kind of mental laziness it is a simple story you tell we need to get tough we needed to get tough we will have to get tough usually that is a kind of warning signal another kind of problem with stories is you can only fit so many stories into your mind at once or in the course of a day or even over the course of a lifetime so your stories are serving too many purposes for instance just to get out of bed in the morning you tell yourself the story that your job is really important what youre doing is really important and maybe it is but i tell myself that story even when it is not,True,False,bad,,,,,,
im not sure i was the bad guy in the sense of having evil intent but it was very hard for me to get away with that story one interesting thing about cognitive biases is they are the subject of so many books these days there is the nudge book the sway book the blink book like the one title book all about the ways in which we screw up and there are so many ways but what i find interesting is that none of these books identify what to me is the single central most important way we screw up and that is that we tell ourselves too many stories or we are too easily seduced by stories why dont these books tell us that it is because the books themselves are all about stories the more of these books you read youre learning about some of your biases but youre making some of your other biases essentially worse so the books themselves are part of your cognitive bias often people buy them as a kind of talisman like i bought this book i wont be,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it is like people want to hear the worst so psychologically they can prepare for it or defend against it it is why there is such a market for pessimism but to think that by buying the book gets you somewhere that is maybe the bigger fallacy it is just like the evidence that shows that the most dangerous people are those who have been taught some financial literacy theyre the ones who go out and make the worst mistakes it is the people who realize they dont know anything at all that end up doing pretty well a third problem with stories is that outsiders manipulate us using stories and we all like to think advertising only works on the other guy but of course that is not how it is advertising works on all of us so if youre too attached to stories what will happen is people selling products come along and they will bundle their product with a story youre like hey a free story and you end up buying the product because the product and the story go together,True,False,bad,,,,,,
let us consider two kinds of stories about cars story a is buy this car and you will have beautiful romantic partners and a fascinating life,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so how many of you know the story about george washington and the cherry tree it is not obvious that is exactly what happened the story of paul revere it is not obvious that that is exactly the way it happened so again we should be suspicious of stories were biologically programmed to respond to them they contain a lot of information,False,False,good,,,,,,
when we read non fiction books were really being fed stories non fiction is in a sense the new fiction the book may happen to say true things but again everything s taking the same form of these stories so what are the problems of relying too heavily on stories you view your life like this instead of the mess that it is or it ought to be but more specifically i think of a few major problems when we think too much in terms of narrative first narratives tend to be too simple for the point of a narrative is to strip it away not just into minutes but most narratives you can present in a sentence or two when you strip away detail you tend to tell stories in terms of good versus evil whether it is a story about your own life or a story about politics i know some things actually are good versus evil we all know this right but i think as a general rule were too inclined to tell the good versus evil story as a simple rule of thumb just imagine that every time youre telling a good versus evil story youre basically lowering your by ten points or more,False,False,good,,,,,,
usually that is a kind of warning signal another kind of problem with stories is you can only fit so many stories into your mind at once or in the course of a day or even over the course of a lifetime so your stories are serving too many purposes for instance just to get out of bed in the morning you tell yourself the story that your job is really important what youre doing is really important and maybe it is but i tell myself that story even when it is not and you know what that story works it gets me out of bed it is a kind of self deception but the problem comes when i need to change that story the whole point of the story is that i grab onto it and i hold it and it gets me out of bed so when im really doing something that is actually just a waste of time in my mess of a life im too tied into my story that got me out of bed and ideally i ought to have some very complex story map in my mind you know with and a matrix of computation and the like but that is not how stories work,False,False,good,,,,,,
so stories will serve dual and conflicting purposes and very often they will lead us astray i used to think i was within the camp of economists i was one of the good guys and i was allied with other good guys and we were fighting the ideas of the bad guys i used to think that and probably i was wrong maybe sometimes im one of the good guys but on some issues i finally realized hey i wasnt one of the good guys im not sure i was the bad guy in the sense of having evil intent but it was very hard for me to get away with that story,False,False,good,,,,,,
that is one simple way you can never get out of the pattern of thinking in terms of stories but you can improve the extent to which you think in stories and make some better decisions,False,False,good,,,,,,
this weird guy came and he said think in terms of stories let me tell you what happened and you tell your story another possibility is you might tell a story of rebirth you might say i used to think too much in terms of stories but then i heard tyler cowen and now i think less in terms of stories that too is a narrative you will remember you can tell to other people and again it may stick you also could tell a story of deep tragedy this guy tyler cowen came and he told us not to think in terms of stories but all he could do was tell us stories about how other people think too much in terms of stories so today which is it is it like quest rebirth tragedy or maybe some combination of the three im really not sure and im not here to tell you to burn your player and throw out your tolstoy to think in terms of stories is fundamentally human there is a gabriel garcia marquez memoir living to tell the tale that we use memory in stories to make sense of what weve done to give meaning to our lives to establish connections with other people,False,False,good,,,,,,
i like to think of myself as an honest magician i use a lot of tricks which means that sometimes i have to lie to you now i feel bad about that but people lie every day hold on hey where are you stuck in traffic ill be there soon youve all done it,True,True,good,,,,,,
ill be ready in just a minute darling it is just what ive always wanted you were great deception it is a fundamental part of life now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women assuming the women they asked told the truth,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the type of magic i like and im a magician is magic that uses technology to create illusions so i would like to show you something ive been working on it is an application that i think will be useful for artists multimedia artists in particular it videos across multiple screens of mobile devices i borrowed these three from people here in the audience to show you what i mean and im going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject deception,False,False,good,,,,,,
similar story around the world in the united states probably the most astonishing statistic is a percent increase in autism and autistic spectrum disorders and other learning disabilities again were seeing that trend across europe across north america and in europe there is certain parts of europe where were seeing a four fold increase in certain genital birth defects interestingly one of those birth defects has seen a percent increase in the u s so a real skyrocketing of chronic childhood disease that includes other things like obesity and juvenile diabetes premature puberty so it is interesting for me when im looking for someone who can really talk to me and talk to an audience about these things that probably one of the most important people in the world who can discuss toxicity in babies is expert in frogs,True,True,good,,,,,,
it was a surprise to me as well that i would be talking about pesticides that id be talking about public health because in fact i never thought i would do anything useful,True,True,good,,,,,,
in some cases another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to grew eggs in their testes and you can see these large up eggs bursting through the surface of this male s testes now my wife tells me and im sure penelope can as well that there is nothing more painful than childbirth which that ill never experience i cant really argue that but i would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle would probably be somewhere in the top five,True,True,good,,,,,,
that was the start of my journey to make this film toxic baby and it doesnt take much time to discover some really astonishing statistics with this issue one is that you and i all have between to chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didnt have and many of these chemicals are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents of chronic childhood disease that were seeing across industrialized nations ill show you some statistics so for example in the united kingdom the incidence of childhood leukemia has risen by percent just in a generation very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the u s in canada were now looking at one in canadian children with asthma,False,False,good,,,,,,
normally the testes should make testosterone the male hormone but what does is it turns on an enzyme the machinery if you will that converts testosterone into estrogen,False,False,good,,,,,,
now what is interesting is of course that were still using million pounds of the number one contaminant in drinking water that does the opposite turns on increases estrogen and promotes tumors in rats and is associated with tumors breast cancer in humans what s interesting is in fact the same company that sold us million pounds of the breast cancer promoter now sells us the blocker the exact same company,False,False,good,,,,,,
we thought he must be out of his mind this is our time this is intimate time this is when we can just be who we are and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on while we are still in our why would daddy bring elder revels any other time but not to the christmas celebration and mom overheard us and said well you know what if you really understand the nature of this celebration it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love that is what the celebration is all about it is time to make space to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community so we sucked up,True,True,good,,,,,,
the value of nothing out of nothing comes something that was an essay i wrote when i was years old and i got a b,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and im gonna try and do that within the time span that we were told to stay within and to follow the ted commandments that is actually something that creates a near death experience but near death is good for creativity,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and so im going to use as the metaphor this association quantum mechanics which i really dont understand but im still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor so in quantum mechanics of course you have dark energy and dark matter and it is the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen there is a lot of unknown and you often dont know what it is except by its absence but when you make those associations you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story and what youre finding is what matters the meaning and that is what i look for in my work a personal meaning there is also the uncertainty principle which is part of quantum mechanics as i understand it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and there is the terrible and dreaded observer effect in which youre looking for something and you know things are happening simultaneously and youre looking at it in a different way and youre trying to really look for the about ness or what is this story about and if you try too hard then you will only write the about you wont discover anything and what you were supposed to find what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way is no longer there now i dont want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe like many of our scientists have and so i am going to just throw in string theory here and just say that creative people are and there are levels i think of anxiety,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so i also want to explain because dave eggers said he was going to heckle me if i said anything that was a lie or not true to universal creativity and ive done it this way for half the audience who is scientific when i say we i dont mean you necessarily i mean me and my right brain my left brain and the one that is in between that is the censor and tells me what im saying is wrong and im going do that also by looking at what i think is part of my creative process which includes a number of things that happened actually the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which im creating something new and that includes nature and nurture and what i refer to as nightmares now in the nature area we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something perhaps in our brains some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse like effect,False,False,good,,,,,,
i think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis you know who am i why am i this particular person why am i not black like everybody else and sometimes youre equipped with skills but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity i used to draw i thought i would be an artist and i had a miniature poodle and it wasnt bad but it wasnt really creative because all i could really do was represent in a very one way and i have a sense that i probably copied this from a book and then i also wasnt really shining in a certain area that i wanted to be and you know you look at those scores and it wasnt bad but it was not certainly predictive that i would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words,False,False,good,,,,,,
also one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma and i had the usual kind that i think a lot of people had and that is that you know i had expectations placed on me that figure right there by the way figure right there was a toy given to me when i was but nine years old and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age i have some ones that were long lasting from the age of five to this was supposed to be my side occupation and it led to a sense of failure but actually there was something quite real in my life that happened when i was about and it was discovered that my brother in and then my father six months later had brain tumors and my mother believed that something had gone wrong and she was gonna find out what it was and she was gonna fix it,False,False,good,,,,,,
it was like dont mess with me ive got a plastic fork dont you know strategic but a later response and much more useful would be to try and deconstruct the message behind the words so when the voices warned me not to leave the house then i would thank them for drawing my attention to how unsafe i felt because if i was aware of it then i could do something positive about it but go on to reassure both them and myself that we were safe and didnt need to feel frightened anymore i would set boundaries for the voices and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive yet respectful establishing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another throughout all of this what i would ultimately realize was that each voice was closely related to aspects of myself and that each of them carried overwhelming emotions that id never had an opportunity to process or resolve memories of sexual trauma and abuse of anger shame guilt low self worth the voices took the place of this pain and gave words to it and possibly one of the greatest revelations was when i realized that the most hostile and aggressive voices actually represented the parts of me that had been hurt most profoundly and as such it was these voices that needed to be shown the greatest compassion and care it was armed with this knowledge that ultimately i would gather together my shattered self each fragment represented by a different voice gradually withdraw from all my medication and return to psychiatry only this time from the other side ten years after the voice first came i finally graduated this time with the highest degree in psychology the university had ever given and one year later the highest masters which shall we say isnt bad for a in fact one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam which technically possibly counts as cheating,True,False,bad,,,,,,
left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day brimming with hope and optimism id done well at school expectations for me were high and i gleefully entered the student life of lectures parties and traffic cone theft now appearances of course can be deceptive and to an extent this feisty energetic persona of lecture going and traffic cone stealing was a veneer albeit a very well crafted and convincing one underneath i was actually deeply unhappy insecure and fundamentally frightened frightened of other people of the future of failure and of the emptiness that i felt was within me but i was skilled at hiding it and from the outside appeared to be someone with everything to hope for and aspire to,False,False,good,,,,,,
nice i dont know how you keep it up chris i really dont so nice all week he is the kind of man you could say to chris im really sorry ive crashed your car and it gets worse i crashed it into your house your house has caught fire and what is more your wife has just run off with your best friend and you know that chris would say thank you,True,False,bad,,,,,,
one of the thank you for inviting us one of the things about appearing later on in the ted week is that gradually as the days go by all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say,True,True,good,,,,,,
spectroscopy that was another one parallel universes and so this morning i thought oh well ill just do a card trick,True,False,bad,,,,,,
not only that he is left handed have you noticed this how many people here are left handed you see a lot of the people that i most admire theyre great artists great designers great thinkers theyre left handed and somebody said to me last night you know being left handed you have to learn to write without the ink and somebody was talking about metaphors on monday,False,False,good,,,,,,
so he comes over to this country and he says we need a big fiscal stimulus and everyone goes great he leaves the country and the french and the germans go no no forget about that absolutely not nothing happens he goes to strasburg he says we need more boots on the ground in afghanistan and everyone goes great idea he leaves people go no no no were not going to do that maximum and no rockets no no not going to do it,False,False,good,,,,,,
about architectural agency what i mean by that is that it is time for architecture to do things again not just represent things this is a construction helmet that i received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project i and my firm have ever been involved in i was thrilled to get it i was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet i thought it represented the importance of the architect i stayed thrilled until i got home threw the helmet onto my bed fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we are for decorative purposes only,True,True,good,,,,,,
we took is that the freedoms that we provided the ability to move between stage configurations had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs alright the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb it was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house at first blush you think hey it is crazy what could you possibly gain we created what we like to call,True,True,good,,,,,,
move but they can also be disappeared completely the can fly you can bring large objects into the chamber itself but most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure is something that is represented by this and again this is not all the of the building that is actually built but at least suggests the ideas this building has the ability in short order to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out now if there is anyone here from american airlines please consider doing your christmas party here,True,True,good,,,,,,
as i said this can be done with only two people and with a minimum amount of time this is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it so in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around and think of it being done with just a few people again just a couple people are required,True,True,good,,,,,,
now who do we have to blame we can only blame ourselves over the last years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious and we architects are cowards so as we have faced liability we have stepped back and back and unfortunately where there is liability guess what there is power so eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position way over here,False,False,good,,,,,,
were smart cowards and so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture and we announced hey architecture it is over here in this autonomous language were going to seed control of processes and we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession we actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create now something else happened,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that is when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sketches and that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided but we would merely write it off as merely execution now id argue that that is as absurd as stating that minutes of is the creative act and nine months of gestation and god forbid hours of child labor is merely execution so what do we architects need to do we need to stitch back creation and execution and we need to start processes again instead of objects now if we do this i believe we can go back years and start agency social engineering back into architecture,False,False,good,,,,,,
the first is take core positions with your client i know it is shocking right that architecture would actually say that the second position is actually take positions take joint positions with your client this is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency,False,False,good,,,,,,
take joint positions with your client this is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency but it has to be done together and then only after this is done are you allowed to do this begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions and both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that youve taken now i believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this id like to call it the lost art of productively losing control you do not know what the end result is but i promise you with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment you will arrive at conclusions that will transcend convention and will simply be something that you could not have initially or individually conceived of,False,False,good,,,,,,
and one very important piece i made in those days was balkan baroque and this was the time of the balkan wars and i wanted to create some very strong charismatic image something that could serve for any war at any time because the balkan wars are now finished but there is always some war somewhere so here i am washing two and a half thousand dead big bloody cow bones you cant wash the blood you never can wash shame off the wars so im washing this six hours six days and wars are coming off these bones and becoming possible an unbearable smell but then something stays in the memory i want to show you the one who really changed my life and this was the performance in moma which i just recently made this performance when i said to the curator im just going to sit at the chair and there will be an empty chair at the front and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want the curator said to me that is ridiculous you know this is new york this chair will be empty nobody has time to sit in front of you,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this institute is going to happen in hudson upstate new york and we are trying to build with rem koolhaas an idea and it is very simple if you want to get experience you have to give me your time you have to sign the contract before you enter the building that you will spend there a full six hours you have to give me your word of honor it is something so old fashioned but if you dont respect your own word of honor and you leave before that is not my problem but it is six hours the experience and then after you finish you get a certificate of accomplishment so get home and frame it if you want,True,True,good,,,,,,
after crystal chamber you go to eye gazing chamber after eye gazing chamber you go to a chamber where you are lying down so it is the three basic positions of the human body sitting standing and lying and slow walking and there is a sound chamber and then after youve seen all of this and prepared yourself mentally and physically then you are ready to see something with a long duration like in immaterial art it can be music it can be opera it can be a theater piece it can be film it can be video dance you go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable in the long duration chairs youre transported to the big place where youre going to see the work and if you fall asleep which is very possible because it is been a long day youre going to be transported to the parking lot,True,True,good,,,,,,
and you know sleeping is very important in sleeping youre still receiving art so in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time and then after this you just you know go back you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate so this institute right now is virtual right now i am just making my institute in brazil then it is going to be in australia then it is coming here to canada and everywhere and this is to experience a kind of simple method how you go back to simplicity in your own life counting rice will be another thing,True,True,good,,,,,,
now let us go back in time it s there is the gallery somewhere in the world and there is a young girl age standing in the middle of the space in the front of her is a table on the table there are objects for pleasure and for pain some of the objects are a glass of water a coat a shoe a rose,False,False,good,,,,,,
on the table there are objects for pleasure and for pain some of the objects are a glass of water a coat a shoe a rose but also the knife the razor blade the hammer and the pistol with one bullet there are instructions which say im an object you can use everything on the table on me im taking all responsibility even killing me and the time is six hours the beginning of this performance was easy people would give me the glass of water to drink theyd give me the rose,False,False,good,,,,,,
the beginning of this performance was easy people would give me the glass of water to drink theyd give me the rose but very soon after there was a man who took the scissors and cut my clothes and then they took the thorns of the rose and stuck them in my stomach somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood and i still have the scar the women would tell the men what to do and the men didnt rape me because it was just a normal opening and it was all public and they were with their wives they carried me around and put me on the table and put the knife between my legs and somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple and another person took the pistol and they started a fight,False,False,good,,,,,,
started walking towards the public i was a mess i was half naked i was full of blood and tears were running down my face and everybody escaped they just ran away they could not confront myself with myself as a normal human being and then what happened is i went to the hotel it was at two in the morning and i looked at myself in the mirror and i had a piece of gray hair,False,False,good,,,,,,
what we did but how are we going to do that well for a long time since i was in graduate school ive been messing around making chips that is printing on glass and that is what you see here these little salt spots are just tacked onto glass and so i can put thousands of these on our glass chip and use them as a detection reagent we took our chip over to hewlett packard and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots and this is what you see you can actually see the strands of lying flat on the glass here so what were doing is just printing on glass little flat things and these are going to be markers for pathogens ok i make little robots in lab to make these chips and im really big on disseminating technology if youve got enough money to buy just a camry you can build one of these too and so we put a deep how to guide on the web totally free with basically order shelf parts you can build a array machine in your garage here s the section on the all important emergency stop switch,True,False,bad,,,,,,
you can actually be making chips in your garage and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly it s a lot of fun,True,False,bad,,,,,,
of these chips really looks like and these red spots are in fact signals coming from the virus and each spot represents a different family of virus or species of virus and so that is a hard way to look at things so im just going to encode things as a little grouped by family so you can see the results in a very intuitive way what we did is we took tissue culture cells and infected them with and you can see this little yellow next to and likewise we infected them with that is a and you see a little here and then we did respiratory virus that s the scourge of daycare centers everywhere it is like basically,True,False,bad,,,,,,
day zero nothing happening theyre healthy theyre clean it is amazing actually we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when youre walking around healthy it is pretty clean if youre healthy youre pretty healthy day two we get a very robust pattern and it is very similar to what we get in the lab doing our tissue culture experiment so that is great but again cheap shot right we put a ton of virus up this guy s nose so i mean we wanted it to work,True,False,bad,,,,,,
are two individuals represented by their anonymous id codes they both have weve never seen this pattern in lab we part of their viruses theyre new no one s actually even seen remember our evolutionary conserved sequences were using on this array allow us to detect even novel or viruses because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution here s another guy you can play the diagnosis game yourself here these different blocks represent the different viruses in this family so you can kind of go down the blocks and see where the signal is well doesnt have canine distemper that is probably good,True,False,bad,,,,,,
we started thinking about this project how we would make a single diagnostic assay to screen for all pathogens simultaneously well there is some problems with this idea first of all viruses are pretty complex but theyre also evolving very fast this is a these are things that include the common cold and polio things like this youre looking at the outside shell of the virus and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very very fast and the blue parts are not evolving very fast when people think about making pan viral detection reagents usually it is the fast evolving problem that is an issue because how can we detect things if theyre always changing but evolution is a balance where you have fast change you also have ultra conservation things that almost never change and so we looked into this a little more carefully and im going to show you data now this is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop i took a bunch of these small like the common cold like polio and so on and i just broke them down into small segments,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop i took a bunch of these small like the common cold like polio and so on and i just broke them down into small segments and so took this first example which is called and just break it into small windows and im coloring these small windows blue if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome to that virus these sequences right up here which dont even code for protein by the way are almost absolutely identical across all of these so i could use this sequence as a marker to detect a wide spectrum of viruses without having to make something individual now over here there is great diversity that is where things are evolving fast down here you can see slower evolution less diversity now by the time we get out here to let us say acute bee paralysis virus probably a bad one to have if youre a bee this virus shares almost no similarity to but i can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the right hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here and so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra conservation through evolution how these viruses evolved by just choosing elements or elements in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents,False,False,good,,,,,,
and so what we did and this is a really cool project we just started by making a respiratory virus chip i talked about that you know that situation where you go into the clinic and you dont get diagnosed well we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses on one chip and we threw in herpes virus for good measure i mean why not the first thing you do as a scientist is you make sure stuff works and so what we did is we take tissue culture cells and infect them with various viruses and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells mostly viral stuff and stick it on the array to see where it sticks now if the sequences match theyll stick together and so we can look at spots,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then she told me that they were actually symbols from the mythology i never knew how this was going to influence the artist that i am today you see as a young child i saw art everywhere i remember the house we lived in in in stadium road we had marble floors and you know i would look at the marble floors and i would see all sorts of patterns and designs in it and i thought everybody could see them so i would call my brother and i would be like come and see this marble design see this pattern see this mask and he would tell me i dont see anything so i would use ink and i would trace out what i saw on the floor and then when my mom noticed she got really upset,True,True,good,,,,,,
but that didnt stop me i switched from ink to chalk because i got in trouble a lot with my teachers and my parents so i remember my mom said we are christians why dont you draw like other people why dont you draw landscapes or maybe you draw chairs or furniture or maybe even draw jesus you know i could paint the whole house if i had a chance but when i grew up i knew being an artist was not an option so i wanted to be the person my parents wanted me to be so i went to law school of course that is my dad there he was so proud that day and this was what my notebooks looked like in law school,True,True,good,,,,,,
i was like what how did she even know me i thought this cant be true of course i thought it was a scam the nigerian in me was like nah,True,False,bad,,,,,,
clan whose wealth and resources surpass all that europe ever had whose altar is filled with gold this chant is called the my grandmother used to sing it to me when i was a child in nigeria see an is the song of praise of the people and this particularly speaks of treasures that the west does not have mama that is what i call my grandmother told me many stories about mythology you see the are an ethnic group from the southwestern part of nigeria and i was always fascinated by these stories,False,False,good,,,,,,
mama that is what i call my grandmother told me many stories about mythology you see the are an ethnic group from the southwestern part of nigeria and i was always fascinated by these stories i was always intrigued and culture has inspired my art since i was a child you see african art is not just what you buy at harlem markets in new york every artist has a name and every artist has a story this is my story see mama had tattoos on her arms and her legs as a child i thought she was born with them with beautiful black lines and detailed symbols,False,False,good,,,,,,
piece is called so when you zoom into this piece youre going to see a girl child and the accidental birth the fact that our future is controlled by where we are born now the next one you see a man and a man holding hands a woman and a woman holding hands you see in nigeria same sex relationship is criminalized you can actually get years for that with my art i like to tell stories through my art i like to start a conversation so in this one you see the map of africa you see the questions you see crying and there you see syringes plugged into africa and the natural resources being drained out,False,False,good,,,,,,
so why should we believe the science well scientists dont like talking about science as a matter of belief in fact they would contrast science with faith and they would say belief is the domain of faith and faith is a separate thing apart and distinct from science indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of wager blaise pascal was a century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in god and his wager went like this well if god doesnt exist but i decide to believe in him nothing much is really lost maybe a few hours on sunday,True,True,good,,,,,,
so means having to do with laws and in the ideal case the hypothesis isnt just an idea ideally it is a law of nature why does it matter that it is a law of nature because if it is a law it cant be broken if it is a law then it will always be true in all times and all places no matter what the circumstances are and all of you know of at least one example of a famous law einstein s famous equation which tells us what the relationship is between energy and mass and that relationship is true no matter what now it turns out though that there are several problems with this model the main problem is that it is wrong it s just not true,True,True,good,,,,,,
but this leads us to one final problem if science is what scientists say it is then isnt that just an appeal to authority and werent we all taught in school that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy well here s the paradox of modern science the paradox of the conclusion i think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to that actually science is the appeal to authority but it is not the authority of the individual no matter how smart that individual is like plato or socrates or einstein it is the authority of the collective community you can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd but a very special kind of crowd science does appeal to authority but it is not based on any individual no matter how smart that individual may be it is based on the collective wisdom the collective knowledge the collective work of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust this show me culture illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence of course these people dont really look like scientists because theyre much too happy,True,True,good,,,,,,
or as one of my college professors said he clutched for the handrail of faith he made that leap of faith leaving science and behind now the fact is though for most of us most scientific claims are a leap of faith we cant really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases and indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what id like to argue is yes we should but not for the reason that most of us think most of us were taught in school that the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method we were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims the method that most of us were taught in school we can call it the textbook method is the hypothetical method according to the standard model the textbook model scientists develop hypotheses they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses and then they go out into the world and they say okay well are those consequences true can we observe them taking place in the natural world and if they are true then the scientists say great we know the hypothesis is correct so there are many famous examples in the history of science of scientists doing exactly this,False,False,good,,,,,,
my name is joseph a member of parliament in kenya picture a village and one evening government soldiers come surround the village and ask each elder to bring one boy to school that is how i went to school pretty much a government guy pointing a gun and told my father you have to make a choice i walked very comfortably to this missionary school that was run by an american missionary the first thing the american missionary gave me was a candy i had never in my life ever tasted candy so i said to myself with all these hundred other boys this is where i belong,True,True,good,,,,,,

as a researcher every once in a while you encounter something a little disconcerting and this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you and teaches you that youre very wrong about something that you really believed firmly in and these are unfortunate moments because you go to sleep that night dumber than when you woke up so that is really the goal of my talk is to a communicate that moment to you and b have you leave this session a little dumber than when you entered so i hope i can really accomplish that so this incident that im going to describe really began with some diarrhea,False,False,good,,,,,,
was tough in the beginning what what chicken chicken chicken yeah that was it for the first month that was the extent of vocabulary for some reason she has aphasia which is difficulty with communication she latched on to the word chicken which isnt the best but certainly is not the worst,True,False,bad,,,,,,
when we met oddly enough it was the last time we were in vancouver about years ago we met in vancouver at the airport on a trip that we were both taking to china that i would actually from my background i would call it a boondoggle gabby would fact finding mission she would call it an important fact finding mission she was a state senator at the time and we met here at the airport before a trip to china would you describe it as a whirlwind romance no no no,True,False,bad,,,,,,
yeah we were friends for a long time yes,True,True,good,,,,,,

youve got to find a replacement for me so i didnt actually resign from being an astronaut but i gave up my job and they found a replacement months later maybe about two months later i started about getting my job back which is something when you become this primary caregiver person which some people in the audience here have certainly been in that position it is a challenging role but at some point youve got to figure out when youre going to get your life back and at the time i couldnt ask gabby if she wanted me to go fly in the space shuttle again but i knew she was yes yes yes she was the biggest supporter of my career and i knew it was the right thing to do and yet im trying to imagine mark what that was like going off onto a mission one presumes safely but it is never a guarantee and knowing that gabby is well not only was she still in the hospital on the third day of that flight literally while i was with the space station and youve got two vehicles moving at miles an hour im actually flying it looking out the window a bunch of computers gabby was in brain surgery literally at that time having the final surgery to replace the piece of skull that they took out on the day she was injured with a prosthetic yeah which is the whole side of her head now if any of you guys would ever come to our house in tucson for the first time gabby would usually go up to the freezer and pull out the piece of tupperware that has the real skull,True,True,good,,,,,,

yeah it is amazing it is amazing how everything can change for any of us in an instant people dont realize that i certainly didnt gabby giffords yes and on that saturday morning i got this horrible phone call from chief of staff she didnt have much other information she just said gabby was shot a few minutes later i called her back and i actually thought for a second well maybe i just imagined getting this phone call i called her back and that is when she told me that gabby had been shot in the head,False,False,good,,,,,,
pm gabby what is been the toughest challenge for you during this recovery talking really hard really yeah with aphasia gabby knows what she wants to say she just cant get it out she understands everything but the communication is just very difficult because when you look at the picture the part of your brain where those communication centers are are on the left side of your head which is where the bullet passed through,False,False,good,,,,,,
a year ago we were invited by the swiss embassy in berlin to present our art projects we are used to invitations but this invitation really thrilled us the swiss embassy in berlin is special it is the only old building in the government district that was not destroyed during the second world war and it sits right next to the federal no one is closer to chancellor merkel than the swiss diplomats,True,True,good,,,,,,
and this is crucial in another context over the last couple of years we learned that from the roofs of the us and the british embassy the secret services have been listening to the entire district including the mobile phone of angela merkel the antennas of the british are hidden in a white cylindrical while the listening post of the american is covered by radio transparent screens but how to address these hidden and disguised forces with my colleague christoph wachter we accepted the invitation of the swiss embassy and we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation if people are spying on us it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying,True,True,good,,,,,,
on the roof of the swiss embassy we installed a series of antennas they werent as sophisticated as those used by the americans and the british,True,False,bad,,,,,,
they were makeshift can antennas not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible the academy of arts joined the project and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop exactly between the listening posts of the and the,True,False,bad,,,,,,
is watching we are part of your organizations expect us we will shutdown this is the achilles heel open networks agents what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren my neighbors are noisy please send a drone strike,True,True,good,,,,,,
the tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication if we become aware of the constellation the terms and conditions of communication it not only broadens our horizon it allows us to look behind the regulations that limit our our specific social political or aesthetic conventions,False,False,good,,,,,,
look at an actual example the fate of people living in the makeshift settlements on the outskirts of paris is hidden and faded from view it is a vicious circle it is not poverty not racism not exclusion that are new what is new is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange such makeshift settlements are considered illegal and therefore those living in them dont have a chance of making their voices heard on the contrary every time they appear every time they risk becoming visible merely gives grounds for further persecution expulsion and suppression,False,False,good,,,,,,
such makeshift settlements are considered illegal and therefore those living in them dont have a chance of making their voices heard on the contrary every time they appear every time they risk becoming visible merely gives grounds for further persecution expulsion and suppression what interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side we were searching for an interface and we found one it is not a digital interface but a physical one it is a hotel we named the project hotel together with roma families we created several hotel in europe for example in in germany in near paris and also in the balkans these are real hotels people can stay there,False,False,good,,,,,,
these are real hotels people can stay there but they arent a commercial enterprise they are a symbol you can go online and ask for a personal invitation to come and live for a few days in the hotel in their homes eating working and living with the roma families here the roma families are not the travelers the visitors are here the roma families are not a minority the visitors are the point is not to make judgments but rather to find out about the context that determines these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions in the world of globalization the continents are drifting closer to each other,False,False,good,,,,,,
the interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system are veiled by the australian authorities these procedures are declared to be secret military operations,False,False,good,,,,,,
armed with this information from the together with some colleagues here at cern we computed the probability that our universe could quantum tunnel into the ultra dense higgs state and we found a very intriguing result our calculations showed that the measured value of the higgs mass is very special it has just the right value to keep the universe hanging in an unstable situation the higgs field is in a wobbly configuration that has lasted so far but that will eventually collapse so according to these calculations we are like campers who accidentally set their tent at the edge of a cliff and eventually the higgs field will undergo a phase transition and matter will collapse into itself so is this how humanity is going to disappear i dont think so our calculation shows that quantum tunneling of the higgs field is not likely to occur in the next to the years and this is a very long time it s even longer than the time it takes for italy to form a stable government,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but for me the biggest surprise of that day was that there was no big surprise in the eye of a theoretical physicist the higgs is a clever explanation of how some elementary particles gain mass but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory and incomplete solution,False,False,good,,,,,,
later when this material was translated into a common european language which is to say latin they simply replaced the greek kai with the latin x and once that happened once this material was in latin it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost years but now we have the answer to our question why is it that x is the unknown x is the unknown because you cant say sh in spanish,True,True,good,,,,,,
i have the answer to a question that weve all asked the question is why is it that the letter x represents the unknown now i know we learned that in math class but now it is everywhere in the culture the x prize the x files project x whered that come from about six years ago i decided that i would learn arabic which turns out to be a supremely logical language to write a word or a phrase or a sentence in arabic is like crafting an equation because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information,False,False,good,,,,,,
for the first time in my life i just felt viscerally connected to the universe in all of its time stopped or it just kind of felt nonexistent and what i with my eyes i didnt just see it it felt like a vision and i stood there in this nirvana for all of seconds less than three minutes when all of a sudden it was over the sun burst out the blue sky returned the stars and the planets and the corona were gone the world returned to normal but i had changed and that is how i became an an eclipse chaser,True,True,good,,,,,,
you see the story was about an eclipse a partial solar eclipse that was set to cross the country in may of and the astronomer i interviewed him and he explained what was going to happen and how to view it but he emphasized that as interesting as a partial solar eclipse is a much rarer total solar eclipse is completely different in a total eclipse for all of two or three minutes the moon completely blocks the face of the sun creating what he described as the most awe inspiring spectacle in all of nature and so the advice he gave me was this before you die he said you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse well honestly i felt a little uncomfortable hearing that from someone i didnt know very well it felt sort of intimate but it got my attention and so i did some research now the thing about total eclipses is if you wait for one to come to you youre going to be waiting a long time,False,False,good,,,,,,

and what kind of wireless technology are we going to use this is my big vision there is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide respond to emergencies get traffic moving provide a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce emissions in every sector and this is a moment from the graduate do you remember this moment you guys are going to be the handsome young guy and im going to be the wise businessman i want to say one word to you just one word yes sir are you listening yes i am ad hoc peer self configuring wireless networks,True,True,good,,,,,,
im going to talk about two stories today one is how we need to use market based pricing to affect demand and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions in the transportation sector and the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technologies how we can generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce in the other sectors im really scared we need to reduce emissions in ten to fifteen years by percent in order to avert catastrophic effects and i am astounded that im standing here to tell you that,False,False,good,,,,,,
im really scared we need to reduce emissions in ten to fifteen years by percent in order to avert catastrophic effects and i am astounded that im standing here to tell you that what are catastrophic effects a three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in percent species extinction it is not a movie this is real life and im really worried because when people talk about cars which i know something about the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking let us use fuel efficient cars if we started today years from now at the end of this window of opportunity those fuel efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent that is not enough,False,False,good,,,,,,
asked by your chinese friend what is your zodiac sign dont think they are making small talk if you say im a monkey they immediately know you are either or years old,True,True,good,,,,,,
the chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others so parents choose specific years to give birth to babies because they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals can give prosperity to families we even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations im a pig i should have perfect romance with tigers goats and rabbits chinese people believe some animals are natural enemies as a pig i need to be careful with a snake raise your hand if you are a snake let s have a chat later,True,True,good,,,,,,
jack parents must have been very proud and they are not the only ones in the year of the dragon the birthrate in china hong kong and taiwan increased by five percent that means another one million more babies with a traditional preference to baby boys the boy girl ratio that year was to when those dragon boys grow up they will face much more severe competition in love and job markets according to the bbc and the chinese government s press release january saw a peak of sections why that was the last month for the year of the horse it s not because they like horses so much it is because they try to avoid having unlucky goat babies,True,True,good,,,,,,
if you are a goat please dont feel bad those are goat babies they dont look like losers to me,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it is a cycle labeled with animals starting with a rat and ending with a pig and has no association with constellations for example if you were born in you are a rabbit can you see your zodiac sign there our chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework based on yin and yang the five elements and the zodiac animals over thousands of years this popular culture has affected people s major decisions such as naming marriage giving birth and attitude towards each other,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is everyone s dream to have a dragon baby jack parents must have been very proud and they are not the only ones in the year of the dragon the birthrate in china hong kong and taiwan increased by five percent,False,False,good,,,,,,
perhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse as those tiger and goat babies will face much less competition maybe they are the lucky ones i went through the forbes top richest people in the world and it is interesting to see the most undesirable two animals the goat and tiger are at the top of the chart even higher than the dragon so maybe we should consider maybe it is much better to have less competition,False,False,good,,,,,,
and back in the they used to teach student to take x rays thankfully not on you and i but on dead people so ive still got access to one of these dead people called frieda she is falling apart im afraid because she is very old and fragile but everyone on that bus is frieda and the bus is taken with a cargo scanning x ray which is the sort of machine you have on borders which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things fairly obvious what that is so using large scale objects does sort of create drama because you just dont see x rays of big things that often technology is moving ahead and these large cargo scanner x rays that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better again though to make it come alive you need somehow to add the human element and i think the reason this image works again is because frieda is driving the bulldozer,True,True,good,,,,,,
quite a difficult brief make a pair of men s pants look beautiful but i think the process in itself shows how exquisite they are fashion now im sort of anti fashion because i dont show the surface i show what is within so the dont really like me because it doesnt matter if kate moss is wearing it or if im wearing it it looks the same,True,True,good,,,,,,
and im sure ross can associate that with design the design comes from within it is not just i get some strange looks when i go out getting my props here i was fumbling around in the ladies underwear department of a department store almost got escorted from the premises i live opposite a farm and this was the of the litter a piglet that died and what is really interesting is if you look at the legs youll notice that the bones havent fused and should that pig have grown unfortunately it was dead it would have certainly been dead after i x rayed it with the amount of radiation i used anyway,True,False,bad,,,,,,
if you look at the roof of the eden project or the british library it is all this honeycomb structure and im sure those architects are inspired as i am by what surrounds us by nature this in fact is a victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond an amaryllis flower looking really three dimensional seaweed ebbing in the tide now how do i do this and where do i do this and all of that sort of thing this is my new purpose built x ray shed and the door to my x ray room is made of lead and steel it weighs kilograms and the only exercise i get is opening and closing it,True,True,good,,,,,,
so when you move forward from something fairly small a dress which is this size onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process you can see that that is a lot of work in fact that is three months solid x there is over separate components boeing sent me a in containers and i sent them back an x ray,True,True,good,,,,,,
one on the extreme right is a photograph of an american the one on the left is an x ray but this time i had to use a real body because i needed all the skin tissue to make it look real to make it look like it was a real athlete so here i had to use a recently deceased body and getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious but people do donate their bodies to art and science and when they do im in the queue so i like to use them,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so years ago dr x rayed his wife s hand quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch im not sure it seems a bit extreme to me that image was the start of the x ray technology and im still fundamentally using the same principles today im interpreting it in a more contemporary manner,False,False,good,,,,,,
the first shot i ever did was of a soda can which was to promote a brand that we all know so im not going to do them any favors by showing you it but the second shot i did was my shoes i was wearing on the day and i do really like this shot because it shows all the detritus that is sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers it was just one of those pot luck things where you get it right first time moving on to something a bit larger this is an x ray of a bus and the bus is full of people it s actually the same person,False,False,good,,,,,,
and if it is well made i show it if it is badly made i show it and im sure ross can associate that with design the design comes from within,False,False,good,,,,,,
and to carry on with a theme that weve already touched with is how nature is related to architecture if you look at the roof of the eden project or the british library it is all this honeycomb structure and im sure those architects are inspired as i am by what surrounds us by nature,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is a quite high powered x ray machine what is interesting really about x ray really is if you think about it is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs or looking for contraband or whatever and i use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful,False,False,good,,,,,,
so still working with film im afraid technology in x ray where it is life size processed apart from these large cargo scanning machines hasnt moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what i want to do with it which is show my pictures big so i have to use a drum scanner which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film they scan each individual x ray and this shows how i do my process of same size x rays so this is again my daughter s dress still has the tag in it from me buying it so i can take it back to the shop if she didnt like it,False,False,good,,,,,,

that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it so now what we do is take a genome we make maybe copies of it we cut all those copies up into little reads and then we sequence them massively parallel then we bring that into software and reassemble it and tell you what the story is so to give you a picture of what this looks like the human genome project right one run on one of these modern machines in a week and that is going to change to this summer and there is no sign of this pace slowing the price of a base to sequence a base has fallen million times that s the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in waiting until and now you can drive to jupiter and back twice,True,False,bad,,,,,,

who is here today with your significant other just turn over to them swab their mouth send it to the lab and youll know for sure,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that was all done on a machine like this it costs about a dollar for each base a very slow way of doing it well folks im here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it so now what we do is take a genome we make maybe copies of it we cut all those copies up into little reads and then we sequence them massively parallel,False,False,good,,,,,,
so the worldwide capacity to sequence human is something like to human this year we know this based on the machines that are being placed this is expected to double triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future in fact there is one lab in particular that represents percent of all that capacity it is called the beijing institute,False,False,good,,,,,,
two years later she comes back with stage ovarian cancer unfortunately treated again with surgery and chemotherapy she comes back three years later at age with more ovarian cancer more chemotherapy six months later she comes back with acute leukemia she goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later so first the way in which this woman was treated in as little as years will look like bloodletting and it is because of people like my colleague rick wilson at the genome institute at washington university who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem and he took skin cells healthy skin and cancerous bone marrow and the whole of both of them in a couple of weeks no big deal then he compared those two in software and what he found among other things was a deletion a deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called if you have this deleterious mutation in this gene youre percent likely to get cancer in your life,False,False,good,,,,,,
so unfortunately this doesnt help this woman but it does have severe profound if you will implications to her family i mean if they have the same mutation and they get this genetic test and they understand it then they can get regular screens and can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life let me introduce you to the beery twins diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two their mom is a very brave woman who didnt believe it the symptoms werent matching up and through some heroic efforts and a lot of internet searching she was able to convince the medical community that in fact they had something else they had dopa responsive and so they were given l dopa and their symptoms did improve but they werent totally asymptomatic,False,False,good,,,,,,
so on top of l dopa they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug and theyre effectively normal now guys this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing at the time this was a few years ago it cost today it is next year the year after give or take a year that is how fast this is moving so here s little nick likes batman and squirt guns and it turns out nick shows up at the children s hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim and it is not that he is not eating it is that when he eats his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut so a hundred surgeries later he looks at his mom and says mom please pray for me,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is here and what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra years just because of this one thing which is a fantastic story unless you think about humanity s footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production so it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn wheat soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought of flood of pests and pesticides,False,False,good,,,,,,
like me raise your hand anybody nobody typically there is one or two so my father s father was one of resnick brothers,False,False,good,,,,,,
even that is more complicated than you think a friend of mine works in psychiatry and he is interested in the question of why people do and dont take their so or something like that you have to take for a while he has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in india and saying have you taken your yes have you taken it every day yes have you taken if for a month yes what the guy actually meant was that hed fed a dose of to his dog that morning,True,True,good,,,,,,
about something which requires quantitative analysis and so the solution that we and many other people are thinking about there and at this point there is a dramatic flourish and out comes the universal solution to everything these days which is a cell phone in this particular case a camera phone theyre everywhere six billion a month in india and the idea is that what one does is to take the device you dip it you develop the color you take a picture the picture goes to a central laboratory you dont have to send out a doctor you send out somebody who can just take the sample and in the clinic either a doctor or ideally a computer in this case does the analysis turns out to work actually quite well particularly when your color printer has printed the color bars that indicate how things work so my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor but an old otherwise unemployed who has two things a backpack full of these tests and a lancet to occasionally take a blood sample and an and these are the things that get him through his day,True,False,bad,,,,,,
this is one one of the things you occasionally need to do is separate blood cells from serum and the question was here we do it by taking a sample we put it in a centrifuge we spin it and you get blood cells out terrific what happens if you dont have electricity a centrifuge and whatever and we thought for a while of how you might do this and the way in fact you do it is what is shown here you get an which is everywhere and you saw off a blade and then you take tubing and you stick it on that you put the blood in somebody sits there and spins it it works really really well and we sat down we did the physics of and self aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing and sent it off to a journal we were very proud of this particularly the title which was as centrifuge,True,True,good,,,,,,
i called up the editor and i said what is going on how is this possible the editor said with enormous disdain i read this and were not going to publish it because we only publish science,True,True,good,,,,,,
how do you provide medically relevant information at as close as possible to zero cost how do you do it let me just give you two examples the rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world poor resources a rigorous environment a series of problems light weight and things of this kind and also theyre not so different from the home health care and diagnostic system world so the technology i want to talk about is for the third world for the developing world but it has i think much broader application because information is so important in the health care system so you see two examples here one is a lab that is actually a fairly high end laboratory in africa the second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who at a table in a market,False,False,good,,,,,,
approach we took was the other way around to ask what is the cheapest possible stuff that you could make a diagnostic system out of and get useful information and add function and what weve chosen is paper what you see here is a device it is about a centimeter on the side it is about the size of a fingernail the lines around the edges are a polymer it is made of paper and paper of course wicks fluid as you know paper cloth drop wine on the tablecloth and the wine wicks all over everything,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is made of paper and paper of course wicks fluid as you know paper cloth drop wine on the tablecloth and the wine wicks all over everything put it on your shirt it ruins the shirt that is what a hydrophilic surface does so in this device the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it in a drop of in this case urine the fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine the blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine and the combination of those two is a first order shot at a number of useful things that you want so this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper,False,False,good,,,,,,
now how simple can you make the production why do we choose paper there is an example of the same thing on a finger showing you basically what it looks like one reason for using paper is that it is everywhere we have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper and wraps and all kinds of stuff so the production capability is there the second is you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place,False,False,good,,,,,,

in the fall of a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the he showed it to javier they called me they said let us present this to the leaders of our country so in december we met in miami in a hotel conference room i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are how much more valuable they are than they cost and i used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city notice land that is worth thousands of dollars in some cases per square meter but it was a fairly abstract discussion and at some point when there was a pause octavio said paul maybe we could watch the,True,True,good,,,,,,
in i decided that we needed to how we thought about economic development our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents now were a long way away from that goal right now there are billions of people in developing countries who dont have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them but the amazing thing about cities is theyre worth so much more than it costs to build them so we could easily supply the world with dozens maybe hundreds of new cities,False,False,good,,,,,,
so im still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity as it relates to nature as it relates to the spiritual and im not even sure we know what technology is and one definition of technology is that which is first recorded this is the first example of the modern use of technology that i can find it was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the applied arts and science at cambridge university in before that obviously technology didnt exist but obviously it did i like one of the definitions that alan kay has for technology he says technology is anything that was invented after you were born,True,True,good,,,,,,
so it sums up a lot of what were talking about danny hillis actually has an update on that he says technology is anything that doesnt quite work yet,True,False,bad,,,,,,
something that was deeper and as i struggled to understand that i came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations and im this morning going to talk about this for the first time,False,False,good,,,,,,
question that i came up with was this question what does technology want and by that i dont mean does it want chocolate or vanilla by what it wants i mean what are its inherent trends and biases what are its tendencies over time one way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms which weve heard a lot about and the trick that richard dawkins does which is to say to look at them as simply as genes as vehicles for genes,False,False,good,,,,,,
we can record these acoustic signatures from mosquitoes ill tell you exactly how to do this i caught some mosquitoes outside unlike bill gates im not going to release them,True,True,good,,,,,,
the living world far supersedes our imagination of how things actually work boy oh my god right oh my god i hadnt realized this would be such a universal phrase over the last two years in my lab we built and shipped them to countries in the world at no cost to the kids we sent them to this year alone with the support of our community we are planning to ship a million microscopes to kids around the world,False,False,good,,,,,,
there is a pharmacologist who came up with a new way to detect fake drugs anywhere there is a girl who wondered how does glitter actually work and discovered the physics of crystalline formation in glitter there is an argentinian doctor who is trying to do field cervical cancer screening with this tool and yours very truly found a species of flea that was dug inside my heel in my foot one centimeter deep now you might think of these as anomalies but there is a method to this madness i call this frugal science the idea of sharing the experience of science and not just the information to remind you there are a billion people on this planet who live with absolutely no infrastructure no roads no electricity and thus no health care also there a billion kids on this planet that live in poverty,False,False,good,,,,,,
the opinion we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case i mean our brief it was pretty good but not this good how did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time we just could not comprehend how this had happened so it turned out judge clerk working for him at the time was not just a lawyer he was a scientist he was not just a scientist he had a in molecular biology,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the court of appeals for the federal circuit hears all patent cases and it has a reputation for being very very pro patent so even with this remarkable development we expected to lose and we did sort of ends up split decision to but the two judges who ruled against us did so for completely different reasons the first one judge lourie made up his own novel biological theory totally wrong,True,False,bad,,,,,,
supreme court only hears about one percent of the cases that it receives and it agreed to hear ours the day of the oral argument arrives and it was really really exciting long line of people outside people had been standing in line since in the morning to try to get into the courthouse two breast cancer organizations breast cancer action and force had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps chris and i sat quietly in the hallway moments before he was to walk in and argue the most important case of his career i was clearly more nervous than he was but any remaining panic subsided as i walked into the courtroom and looked around at a sea of friendly faces our individual women clients who had shared their deeply personal stories the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers to dedicate themselves to this fight and representatives from a diverse array of medical patient advocacy environmental and religious organizations who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case also in the room were three leaders of the human genome project including the co discoverer of himself james watson who had submitted a brief to the court where he referred to gene patenting as lunacy,True,False,bad,,,,,,
argument itself was riveting chris argued brilliantly but for me the most thrilling aspect was watching the supreme court justices grapple with isolated through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years justice kagan likened isolating to extracting a medicinal plant from the amazon justice roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree and in one of my absolutely favorite moments justice sotomayor proclaimed isolated to be just nature sitting there,True,True,good,,,,,,
of course the decision goes far beyond myriad it ends a practice of allowing patents on human genes in the united states it clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation and it helps to ensure that patients like abigail kathleen and eileen have access to the tests that they need a few weeks after the court issued its decision i received a small package in the mail it was from bob cook deegan a professor at duke university and one the very first people chris and i went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case i opened it up to find a small stuffed animal,True,True,good,,,,,,
it was an afternoon in the fall of i was working at the as the organization s science advisor i really really loved my job but i was having one of those days where i was feeling just a little bit discouraged so i wandered down the hallway to my colleague chris hansen s office chris had been at the for more than years so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights i explained to chris that i was feeling a little bit stuck,False,False,good,,,,,,
gene patent proponents say see we didnt patent the gene in your body we patented an isolated gene and that is true but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated and the patents werent just to a particular gene that they isolated but on every possible version of that gene so what does that mean that means that you cant give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it say to see if it has any mutations without permission of the patent holder it also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing allowing patent holders often private companies to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients,False,False,good,,,,,,
abigail a old with long syndrome a serious heart condition that if left untreated can result in sudden death the company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome but then they went bankrupt and they never offered it so another lab tried to offer the test but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement so as a result for years no test was available during that time abigail died of undiagnosed long gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients,False,False,good,,,,,,
out that the supreme court has made clear through a long line of cases that certain things are not patent eligible you cant patent products of nature the air the water minerals elements of the periodic table and you cant patent laws of nature the law of gravity e these things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all and reserved exclusively to none it seemed to us that the most fundamental structure of life that codes for the production of all of our proteins is both a product of nature and a law of nature regardless of whether it is in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube as we delved into this issue we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts scientists medical professionals lawyers patent lawyers,False,False,good,,,,,,
now i narrowed it down to the gray one the green one and say the orange one so by a show of hands well start with the easiest one show of hands how many people think it is the gray one really okay how many people think it is the green one and how many people think it is the orange one pretty even split let us find out what the reality is here is the orange one,True,False,bad,,,,,,
here is the green one and here is the gray one,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality even at the simplest thing the brain does which is color so if i could have the lights down up here i want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same one is simply the flipping of the other now i want you to look at that dot between the green and the red and i want you to stare at that dot dont look anywhere else were going to look at it for about seconds which is a bit of a killer in an talk,True,True,good,,,,,,
here you have the hive you can see the queen bee the large bee in the middle those are her daughters the eggs they go back and forth between this hive and the arena via this tube youll see one of the bees come out here you see how she has a little number on her there is another one coming out she also has a number on her now theyre not born that way right we pull them out put them in the fridge and they fall asleep then you can little numbers on them,True,True,good,,,,,,
and now in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers they land on the flower stick their tongue in there called a proboscis and drink sugar water she is drinking a glass of water that is about that big to you and i will do that about three times then fly and sometimes they learn not to go to the blue but to go where the other bees go so they copy each other they can count to five they can recognize faces and here she comes down the ladder and shell come into the hive find an empty honey pot and throw up and that is honey,True,True,good,,,,,,
now some of you will have noticed that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right or your left is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right agreed yes okay so they are physically the same let us pull the covers off now remember you know that the middle nine are exactly the same do they look the same no the question is is that an illusion and ill leave you with that so thank you very much,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i want to start with a game okay and to win this game all you have to do is see the reality that is in front of you as it really is all right so we have two panels here of colored dots and one of those dots is the same in the two panels and you have to tell me which one,False,False,good,,,,,,
can anyone see it anyone no now let us see the surfaces according to the quality of light that they reflect and now you see it so color enables us to see the similarities and differences between surfaces according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect,False,False,good,,,,,,
this is a huge problem because it means that the same image could have an infinite number of possible real world sources let me show you what i mean imagine that this is the back of your eye okay and these are two projections from the world theyre identical in every single way identical in shape size content they are the same as far as your eye is concerned and yet they come from completely different sources the one on the right comes from a yellow surface in shadow oriented facing the left viewed through a pinkish medium,False,False,good,,,,,,
they are the same as far as your eye is concerned and yet they come from completely different sources the one on the right comes from a yellow surface in shadow oriented facing the left viewed through a pinkish medium the one on the left comes from an orange surface under direct light facing to the right viewed through sort of a bluish pletely different meanings giving rise to the exact same retinal information and yet it is only the retinal information that we get so how on earth do we even see so if you remember anything in this next minutes remember this that the light that falls onto your eye sensory information is meaningless because it could mean literally anything and what is true for sensory information is true for information generally there s no inherent meaning in information,False,False,good,,,,,,
what are you reading half the letters are missing right there is no a reason why an h has to go between that w and a but you put one there why because in the statistics of your past experience it would have been useful to do so so you do so again and yet you dont put a letter after that first t why because it wouldnt have been useful in the past so you dont do it again so let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality even at the simplest thing the brain does which is color so if i could have the lights down up here,False,False,good,,,,,,
can i have the lights up again i take it from your response they dont look the same anymore right why because your brain is seeing that same information as if the right one is still under red light and the left one is still under green light that s your new normal,False,False,good,,,,,,

a real concern because between and terrorism incidents increased by percent the number of deaths from terrorism went up percent right now two billion people live in conditions of fragility conflict violence and by more than percent of the world s poor will live in these situations of fragility conflict and violence and so what do we do about meeting these aspirations are there new ways of thinking about how we can rise to meet these aspirations because if we dont im extremely worried aspirations are rising as never before because of access to the internet,False,False,good,,,,,,
right now two billion people live in conditions of fragility conflict violence and by more than percent of the world s poor will live in these situations of fragility conflict and violence and so what do we do about meeting these aspirations are there new ways of thinking about how we can rise to meet these aspirations because if we dont im extremely worried aspirations are rising as never before because of access to the internet everyone knows how everyone else lives has our ability to meet those aspirations risen as well and just to get at the details of this i want to share with you my own personal story this is not my mother but during the korean war my mother literally took her own sister her younger sister on her back and walked at least part of the way to escape seoul during the korean war now through a series of miracles my mother and father both got scholarships to go to new york city they actually met in new york city and got married in new york city my father too was a refugee,False,False,good,,,,,,
they actually met in new york city and got married in new york city my father too was a refugee at the age of he left his family in the northern part of the country escaped through the border and never saw his family again now when they were married and living in new york my father was a waiter at patricia murphy s restaurant their aspirations went up they understood what it was like to live in a place like new york city in the well my brother was born and they came back to korea and we had what i remember as kind of an idyllic life but what was happening in korea at that time was the country was one of the poorest in the world and there was political upheaval there were demonstrations just down the street from our house all the time students protesting against the military government and at the time the aspirations of the world bank group the organization i lead now were extremely low for korea,False,False,good,,,,,,
there were demonstrations just down the street from our house all the time students protesting against the military government and at the time the aspirations of the world bank group the organization i lead now were extremely low for korea their idea was that korea would find it difficult without foreign aid to provide its people with more than the bare necessities of life so the situation is korea is in a tough position my parents have seen what life is like in the united states they got married there my brother was born there and they felt that in order to give us an opportunity to reach their aspirations for us we had to go and come back to the united states now we came back first we went to dallas,False,False,good,,,,,,

hear very different narratives in working with male business owners and i think this difference is costing women cents on the dollar id like to tell you the story of a consulting firm that helps their clients dramatically improve their profitability that company is my company after my first year in business i saw the profit increases that my clients were realizing in working with me and i realized that i needed to reevaluate my pricing i was really underpriced relative to the value i was delivering it s hard for me to admit to you because im a pricing consultant,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that would be really cool instead like this clearly defining and communicating your value are essential to being paid well for your excellence anyone here want to be paid well ok good then this talk is for everyone it is got universal applicability it s true if youre a business owner if youre an employee if youre a job seeker,False,False,good,,,,,,
i approach this today through the lens of the woman business owner because in my work ive observed that women underprice more so than men the gender wage gap is a well traveled narrative in this country according to the bureau of labor statistics a woman employee earns just cents for every dollar a man earns what may surprise you is that this trend continues even into the entrepreneurial sphere a woman business owner earns just cents for every dollar a man earns in my work ive often heard women express that theyre uncomfortable communicating their value especially early on in business ownership,False,False,good,,,,,,
the good news is that some things have changed and the most important thing that is changed is that we can now measure ourselves in ways that used to be the dominion of the health system so a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust i like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid we can reach back and grab that dust and we can learn a lot about health from it so if our choices are part of our health what we eat is a really important aspect of our health so you can do something very simple and basic and take a picture of your food and if enough people do that we can learn a lot about how our food affects our health one interesting thing that came out of this this is an app for called the eatery is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people s pizza is,True,False,bad,,,,,,
as you can see i carry a percent risk of prostate cancer percent risk of psoriasis and a percent risk of alzheimer s disease so that means if youre a geneticist youre freaking out going oh my god you told everyone you carry the allele what is wrong with you right when i got these results i started talking to doctors and they told me not to tell anyone and my reaction is is that going to help anyone cure me when i get the disease and no one could tell me yes and i live in a web world where when you share things beautiful stuff happens not bad stuff so i started putting this in my slide decks and i got even more obnoxious and i went to my doctor and i said id like to actually get my please give me back my data so this is my most recent as you can see i have high cholesterol i have particularly high bad cholesterol and i have some bad liver numbers but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine the night before we ran the test,True,True,good,,,,,,
a commons of data is something that is really unique because we make it from our own data and although a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control around data and obsess around privacy at least some of us really like to share as a form of control and what is remarkable about digital is you dont need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough to generate something massive and beautiful so not that many programmers write free software but we have the apache web server not that many people who read edit but it works so as long as some people like to share as their form of control we can build a commons as long as we can get the information out and in biology the numbers are even better so vanderbilt ran a study asking people wed like to take your your blood and share them in a and only five percent of the people opted out im from tennessee it s not the most science positive state in the united states of america,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and open doesnt mean that there is no money closed systems corporations make a lot of money on the open web and theyre one of the reasons why the open web lives is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness of the system and so all of these things are part of the clinical study that weve created so you can actually come in all you have to be is years old willing to sign a contract that says im not going to be a jerk basically and youre in you can start analyzing the data you do have to solve a as well,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so this is he wrote a book over a thousand years ago called the canon of medicine and the rules he laid out for testing medicines are actually really similar to the rules we have today that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength the medicine needs to be pure and in the end we need to test it in people and so if you put together these themes of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing right you get some beautiful results even when we didnt have very good technologies this is a guy named carlos finlay he had a hypothesis that was way outside the box for his time in the late he thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing,False,False,good,,,,,,
he had a hypothesis that was way outside the box for his time in the late he thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing he thought it was transmitted by mosquitos and they laughed at him for years they called this guy the mosquito man but he ran an experiment in people right he had this hypothesis and he tested it in people so he got volunteers to go move to cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever so some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever,False,False,good,,,,,,
i asked colleagues from universities the government oil gas and mining companies and the answer was a unanimous no and this makes sense you see boiling rivers do exist in the world but theyre generally associated with volcanoes you need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation and as you can see from the red dots here which are volcanoes we dont have volcanoes in the amazon nor in most of peru so it follows we should not expect to see a boiling river telling this same story at a family dinner my aunt tells me but no ive been there ive swum in that river,True,True,good,,,,,,
then my uncle jumps in no she is not kidding you see you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain and it is protected by a powerful shaman your aunt she is friends with his wife,True,False,bad,,,,,,
what was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place and that i was by no means the first outsider to see it it was just part of their everyday life they drink its water they take in its vapor they cook with it clean with it even make their medicines with it i met the shaman and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle he asked for my intentions and listened carefully then to my tremendous relief i was freaking out to be honest with you a smile began to snake across his face and he just laughed,True,False,bad,,,,,,
ive seen all sorts of animals fall in and what is shocking to me is the process is pretty much the same so they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes eyes apparently cook very quickly they turn this milky white color the stream is carrying them theyre trying to swim out but their meat is cooking on the bone because it is so hot so theyre losing power losing power until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out,True,True,good,,,,,,
you know despite all my scientific skepticism i found myself hiking into the jungle guided by my aunt over kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center and well honestly mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary warm stream of the amazon but then i heard something a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer it sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing and as we got closer i saw smoke vapor coming up through the trees,False,False,good,,,,,,
i had received the blessing to study the river on the condition that after i take the water samples and analyze them in my lab wherever i was in the world that i pour the waters back into the ground so that as the shaman said the waters could find their way back home ive been back every year since that first visit in and the fieldwork has been exhilarating demanding and at times dangerous one story was even featured in national geographic magazine i was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts in between an degree c river and a hot spring that well looked like this close to boiling and on top of that it was amazon rain forest pouring rain couldnt see a thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the first murder of a mother by a son was my great okay so that is the first case of and that book is very interesting because it is about witch trials and how people thought back then but it doesnt stop there there were seven more men on my father s side starting then that were all murderers okay now this gives one a little pause,True,False,bad,,,,,,

now the only person it turns out one son and one daughter siblings didnt get along and their patterns are exactly the same they have the same brain and the same eeg and now they are close as can be but there is gonna be bad news somewhere and we dont know where it is going to pop up so that is my talk,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but then for some reason i got into something else just recently and it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me to analyze a bunch of brains of psychopathic killers and so this would be the typical talk i would give,False,False,good,,,,,,
and so this would be the typical talk i would give and the question is how do you end up with a psychopathic killer what i mean by psychopathic killer are these people these types of people and so some of the brains that ive studied are people you know about when i get the brains i dont know what im looking at it is blind experiments they also gave me normal people and everything so ive looked at about of these,False,False,good,,,,,,
ive looked at about of these and what came up was a number of pieces of data so we look at these sorts of things theoretically on the basis of genetics and brain damage and interaction with environment and exactly how that machine works so were interested in exactly where in the brain and what is the most important part of the brain so weve been looking at this the interaction of genes what is called epigenetic effects brain damage and environment and how these are tied together and how you end up with a psychopath and a killer depends on exactly when the damage occurs it is really a very precisely timed thing you get different kinds of psychopaths,False,False,good,,,,,,
so were going along with this and here s just to give you the pattern the pattern is that those people every one of them i looked at who was a murderer and was a serial killer had damage to their orbital cortex which is right above the eyes the orbits and also the interior part of the temporal lobe so there is the pattern that every one of them had but they all were a little different too they had other sorts of brain damage a key thing is that the major violence genes it is called the mao a gene and there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population,False,False,good,,,,,,
and there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population some of you have this and it is sex linked it is on the x chromosome and so in this way you can only get it from your mother and in fact this is probably why mostly men boys are psychopathic killers or are very aggressive because a daughter can get one x from the father one x from the mother it is kind of diluted out but for a son he can only get the x chromosome from his mother,False,False,good,,,,,,
i became obsessed with that sentence but the truth lies and i discovered as i talked to depressive people that they have many delusional perceptions people will say no one loves me and you say i love you your wife loves you your mother loves you you can answer that one pretty readily at least for most people but people who are depressed will also say no matter what we do were all just going to die in the end or theyll say there can be no true communion between two human beings each of us is trapped in his own body to which you have to say that is true but i think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast,True,False,bad,,,,,,
id started off as a medical conservative i thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked it was clear what they were there was medication there were certain there was possibly treatment and that everything else was nonsense but then i discovered something if you have brain cancer and you say that standing on your head for minutes every morning makes you feel better it may make you feel better but you still have brain cancer and youll still probably die from it but if you say that you have depression and standing on your head for minutes every day makes you feel better then it is worked because depression is an illness of how you feel and if you feel better then you are effectively not depressed anymore so i became much more tolerant of the vast world of alternative treatments and i get letters i get hundreds of letters from people writing to tell me about what is worked for them someone was asking me backstage today about meditation my favorite of the letters that i got was the one that came from a woman who wrote and said that she had tried therapy medication she had tried pretty much everything and she had found a solution and hoped i would tell the world and that was making little things from yarn,True,True,good,,,,,,
and yet when i went to look at alternative treatments i also gained perspective on other treatments i went through a tribal in senegal that involved a great deal of blood and that im not going to detail right now but a few years afterwards i was in rwanda working on a different project and i happened to describe my experience to someone and he said well that is west africa and were in east africa and our rituals are in some ways very different but we do have some rituals that have something in common with what youre describing and he said but weve had a lot of trouble with western mental health workers especially the ones who came right after the genocide i said what kind of trouble did you have and he said well they would do this bizarre thing they didnt take people out in the sunshine where you begin to feel better they didnt include drumming or music to get people s blood going they didnt involve the whole community they didnt the depression as an invasive spirit instead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms and had them talk for an hour about bad things that had happened to them,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i said why not and she said it just is too far fetched these people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society and then they get a few months of treatment and theyre virtually ready to run morgan stanley it is just too implausible she said ive never even heard of anything like it and i said the fact that youve never heard of it is an indication that it is news,True,False,bad,,,,,,
what i came up with over time was that the people who deny their experience and say i was depressed a long time ago i never want to think about it again im not going to look at it and im just going to get on with my life ironically those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have shutting out the depression strengthens it while you hide from it it grows and the people who do better are the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition those who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience so frank said to me if i had a do over i suppose i wouldnt do it this way but in a strange way im grateful for what ive experienced im glad to have been in the hospital times it taught me so much about love and my relationship with my parents and my doctors has been so precious to me and will be always and maggie robbins said i used to volunteer in an aids clinic and i would just talk and talk and talk and the people i was dealing with werent very responsive and i thought not very friendly or helpful of them,True,True,good,,,,,,
i felt a funeral in my brain and mourners to and fro kept treading treading till it seemed that sense was breaking through and when they all were seated a service like a drum kept beating beating till i thought my mind was going numb and then i heard them lift a box and creak across my soul with those same boots of lead again then space began to toll as all the heavens were a bell and being but an ear and i and silence some strange race wrecked solitary here and then a plank in reason broke and i fell down and down and hit a world at every plunge and finished knowing then we know depression through metaphors emily dickinson was able to convey it in language goya in an image half the purpose of art is to describe such states as for me i had always thought myself tough one of the people who could survive if id been sent to a concentration camp in i had a series of losses,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then the anxiety set in if you told me that id have to be depressed for the next month i would say as long i know itll be over in november i can do it but if you said to me you have to have acute anxiety for the next month i would rather slit my wrist than go through it it was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if youre walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you but instead of lasting half a second the way that does it lasted for six months it is a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that youre afraid of and it was at that point that i began to think that it was just too painful to be alive and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people and finally one day i woke up and i thought perhaps id had a stroke because i lay in bed completely frozen looking at the telephone thinking something is wrong and i should call for help and i couldnt reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial and finally after four full hours of my lying and staring at it the phone rang and somehow i managed to pick it up and it was my father and i said im in serious trouble,False,False,good,,,,,,
the next day i started with the medications and the therapy and i also started reckoning with this terrible question if im not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp then who am i and if i have to take medication is that medication making me more fully myself or is it making me someone else and how do i feel about it if it is making me someone else i had two advantages as i went into the fight the first is that i knew that objectively speaking i had a nice life and that if i could only get well there was something at the other end that was worth living for,False,False,good,,,,,,
i want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling theyre not very effective theyre extremely costly they come with innumerable side effects theyre a disaster but i am so grateful that i live now and not years ago when there would have been almost nothing to be done i hope that years hence people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science,False,False,good,,,,,,
depression is the flaw in love if you were married to someone and thought well if my wife dies ill find another one it wouldnt be love as we know it there is no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy there are three things people tend to confuse depression grief and sadness grief is explicitly reactive if you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy and then six months later you are still deeply sad but youre functioning a little better it is probably grief and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure if you experience a catastrophic loss and you feel terrible and six months later you can barely function at all then it is probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then she did very well for many years on lithium and then eventually she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it and she had another psychosis and then plunged into the worst depression that i had ever seen in which she sat in her parents apartment more or less catatonic essentially without moving day after day after day and when i interviewed her about that experience some years later she is a poet and psychotherapist named maggie robbins when i interviewed her she said i was singing have all the flowers gone over and over to occupy my mind i was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying which were are nothing you are nobody you dont even deserve to live and that was when i really started thinking about killing myself you dont think in depression that youve put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood you think that the veil has been taken away the veil of happiness and that now youre seeing truly it s easier to help who perceive that there is something foreign inside of them that needs to be but it is difficult with because we believe we are seeing the truth,False,False,good,,,,,,
a lot of people said when i chose to write about my depression that it must be very difficult to be out of that closet to have people know they said do people talk to you differently i said yes people talk to me differently they talk to me differently insofar as they start telling me about their experience or their sister s experience or their friend s experience things are different because now i know that depression is the family secret that everyone has,False,False,good,,,,,,
so im going to start my talk by stop talking and show you a few images that i recently captured so by now my talk is already words long and i feel like i should stop here,True,False,bad,,,,,,
now this looks already quite interesting but let me now add some watercolors to it those are just standard watercolors that you would paint with you wouldnt paint with syringes but it works just the same so what happened now is when the watercolor was flowing into the structure the watercolors do not mix with the that is because the itself is that means it doesnt mix with the water and at the same time it tries to maintain its position above the magnet and therefore it creates those amazing looking structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint so that was the second project let me now turn to the last project which involves the national beverage of scotland,True,True,good,,,,,,
let me demonstrate this over here and what i have here is an empty glass vessel it is got nothing in it and now im going to fill it with oxygen and whiskey add some more now we just wait for a few seconds for the molecules to spread inside the bottle and now let us set that on fire,True,True,good,,,,,,
at the same time i probably owe you some explanation about the images that you just saw what i am trying to do as a photographer as an artist is to bring the world of art and science together whether it is an image of a soap bubble captured at the very moment where it is bursting as you can see in this image whether it is a universe made of tiny little beads of oil paint strange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways or paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces im always trying to link those two fields together what i find very intriguing about those two is that they both look at the same thing they are a response to their surroundings and yet they do it in a very different way if you look at science on one hand science is a very rational approach to its surroundings whereas art on the other hand is usually an emotional approach to its surroundings,False,False,good,,,,,,
first one has to do with making sound visible now as you may know sound travels in waves so if you have a speaker a speaker actually does nothing else than taking the audio signal transform it into a vibration which is then transported through the air is captured by our ear and transformed into an audio signal again now i was thinking how can i make those sound waves visible so i came up with the following setup i took a speaker i placed a thin foil of plastic on top of that speaker and then i added tiny little crystals on top of that speaker and now if i would play a sound through that speaker it would cause the crystals to move up and down now this happens very fast in the blink of an eye so together with we captured this motion with a camera that is able to capture more than frames per second let me show you what this looks like by massive attack thank you very much i agree it looks pretty amazing,False,False,good,,,,,,
strange behavior it is a liquid that is completely black it is got an oily consistency and it is got tiny little particles of metal in it which makes it magnetic so if i now put this liquid into a magnetic field it would change its appearance now ive got a live demonstration over here to show this to you,False,False,good,,,,,,
there is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on in fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant infants dont respond to much there is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board,True,True,good,,,,,,
this brain is very much a thinking machine and by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain it has a person on board and in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self development and by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously in a complex sequence in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game like soccer now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head and where this boy comes from sao paulo brazil about percent of boys of his age have this ability you could go out into the community in monterey and youd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability and if you did hed probably be from sao paulo,True,False,bad,,,,,,
your issues as it relates to this science is how to maintain your own high functioning learning machine and of course a well ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it is key but also in your future is brain aerobics get ready for it it is going to be a part of every life not too far in the future just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period the other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself now that you know now that science is telling us that you are in charge that it is under your control that your happiness your well being your abilities your capacities are capable of continuous modification continuous improvement and youre the responsible agent and party of course a lot of people will ignore this advice it will be a long time before they really understand it,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it has stored recorded can retrieve the meanings of thousands tens of thousands of objects actions and their relationships in the world and those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands potentially millions of ways,False,False,good,,,,,,
every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine in an adult brain of course weve built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory and that define us as acting moving thinking creatures,False,False,good,,,,,,
now we study this as the nerdy laboratory university based scientists that we are by engaging the brains of animals like rats or monkeys or of this particularly curious creature one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth to engage them in learning new skills and abilities and we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired in fact we do this in individuals of any age in these different species that is to say from infancy up to adulthood and old age so we might engage a rat for example to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub skills or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance from these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain the first great epoch is commonly called the critical period,False,False,good,,,,,,
crazy canadian named crosley commercialized this thing called the in it was a really neat idea and ill get to why it didnt work but here s how it works there is two spheres and theyre separated in distance one has a working fluid water and ammonia and the other is a condenser you heat up one side the hot side the ammonia evaporates and it in the other side you let it cool to room temperature and then as the ammonia and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side it creates a powerful cooling effect so it was a great idea that didnt work at all they blew up,True,True,good,,,,,,
gotcha mosquitoes i hate them dont you that awful buzzing sound at night around your ears that drives you absolutely crazy knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood that is awful right in fact there is only one good thing i can think of when it gets to mosquitoes when they fly into our bedroom at night they prefer to bite my wife,True,True,good,,,,,,
if i get it it is a tablet a simple tablet and when i take it with water it does miracles thank you now let me show you how this works here in this box i have a cage with several hundred hungry female mosquitoes,True,True,good,,,,,,
sorry about that im sticking in my arm im giving them a big juicy blood meal im shaking them off and we follow them through time to see these mosquitoes get very very sick indeed here shown in fast motion and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitoes very dead mosquitoes and im going to say ladies and gentlemen we have swapped the cards with mosquitoes they dont kill us we kill them,True,True,good,,,,,,
it is about man s best friend it is about dogs and i will show you how we can use dogs in the fight against malaria one of the best ways of killing mosquitoes is not to wait until they fly around like adults and bite people and transmit disease,False,False,good,,,,,,
in that pool of water these larvae are concentrated theyre all together there they are immobile they cant escape from that water they cant fly and theyre accessible you can actually walk up to that pool and you can kill them there right so the problem that we face with this is that throughout the landscape all these pools of water with the larvae they are scattered all over the place which makes it very hard for an inspector like this to actually find all these breeding sites and treat them with insecticides and last year we thought very very hard how can we resolve this problem until we realized that just like us we have a unique smell mosquito larvae also have a very unique smell and so we set up another crazy experiment because we collected the smell of these larvae put it on pieces of cloth and then did something very remarkable,False,False,good,,,,,,
going to show you is im gonna stick my arm into it and i will show you how quickly they will bite there we go dont worry i do this all the time in the lab there we go ok now on the video on the video here im going to show you exactly the same thing except that what im showing you on the video happened one hour after i took the tablet have a look,False,False,good,,,,,,
and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and she felt it coming because it would shake the earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and grab it on the page and other times she wouldnt be fast enough so shed be running and running and she wouldnt get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and then there were these times this is the piece i never forgot she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it right so she is running to the house and she is looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it is going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so when i heard that i was like that is uncanny that is exactly what my creative process is like,True,True,good,,,,,,
not just bad but the worst book ever written and i started to think i should just dump this project but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i tried it so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and i said aloud listen you thing you and i both know that if this book isnt brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this i dont have any more than this if you want it to be better youve got to show up and do your part of the deal but if you dont do that you know what the hell with it im going to keep writing anyway because that is my job and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job,True,False,bad,,,,,,
and i dont expect that that is ever going to change but that said something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to my whole relationship with this work and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book this memoir called eat pray love which decidedly unlike any of my previous books went out in the world for some reason and became this big mega sensation international bestseller thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea are you comfortable with that because you look at it even from an inch away and you know im not at all comfortable with that assumption i think it is odious and i also think it is dangerous and i dont want to see it perpetuated into the next century i think it is better if we encourage our great creative minds to live and i definitely know that in my case in my situation it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption particularly given the circumstance that im in right now in my career,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome so stay with me because it does circle around and back but ancient greece and ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then ok people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity socrates famously believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius which is great because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then the renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let us put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries and there is no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine and it is the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and i got to tell you i think that was a huge error you know i think that allowing somebody one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all divine creative unknowable eternal mystery is just a too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche,False,False,good,,,,,,
men typically listen so he is saying ive got this problem he is saying here s your solution thanks very much next that is the way we talk right guys expansive listening on the other hand is listening with not listening for it is got no destination in mind it is just enjoying the journey women typically listen if you look at these two eye contact facing each other possibly both talking at the same time,True,False,bad,,,,,,
one translation of which is the world is sound and in a way that is true because everything is vibrating in fact all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies so you are in fact a chord each of you an individual chord one definition of health may be that that chord is in complete harmony,False,False,good,,,,,,
and they realize im right there isnt a square meter of ground in the entire country that hasnt been reclaimed from the sea or otherwise moved modified and manicured to look as if it had always been there it s the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows,True,False,bad,,,,,,
the opposite of course is fake fake all right now there is value for fake there will always be companies around to supply the fake because there will always be desire for the fake fact is there is a general rule if you dont like it it is fake if you do like it it is faux,True,False,bad,,,,,,
you can contrast them by thinking about universal city walk versus disney world or disneyland universal city walk is a real fake in fact we got this very term from ada louise book the unreal america a wonderful book where she talks about universal city walk as you know she decries the fake but she says at least that is a real fake right because you can see behind the facade right it is what it says it is it is universal studio it is in the city of los angeles youre going to walk a lot right you dont tend to walk a lot in los angeles well here s a place where you are going to walk a lot outside in this city but is it really true to itself right is it really in the city is it you can see behind all of it and see what is going on in the facades of it so she calls it a real fake disney world on the other hand is a fake real or a fake reality right it is not what it says it is it s not really the magic kingdom,True,False,bad,,,,,,
then it bought miramax known for its fare and all of a sudden families everywhere couldnt really trust what they were getting from disney it was no longer true to its heritage no longer true to walt disney that is one of the reasons why theyre having such trouble today and why roy disney is out to get michael eisner because it is no longer true to itself so understand what your past limits what you can do in the future when it comes to being what you say you are the easiest mistake that companies make is that they advertise things that they are not that is when youre perceived as fake as a phony company things that youre not think about any hotel any airline any hospital right if you could check into the ads youd have a great experience,True,True,good,,,,,,
so we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy well what then happened over the last or years is that goods have become where theyre treated like a commodity where people dont care who makes them they just care about three things and three things only price price and price now there is an antidote to and that is my first book was called mass it came up a couple of times yesterday and how i discovered this progression of economic value was realizing that customizing a good automatically turned it into a service because it was done just for a particular person because it wasnt inventoried it was delivered on demand to that individual person so we moved from an industrial economy to a service based economy,False,False,good,,,,,,
an industrial economy to a service based economy but over the past or years what is happened is that services are being as well long distance telephone service sold on price price price fast food restaurants with all their value pricing and even the internet is not just goods but services as well what that means is that it is time to move to a new level of economic value time to go beyond the goods and the services and use in that same what happens when you customize a service what happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person that is exactly what they need at this moment in time then you cant help but make them go wow you cant help but turn it into a memorable event you cant help but turn it into an experience so were shifting to an experience economy where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering,False,False,good,,,,,,
so were shifting to an experience economy where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering now most places that i talk to when i talk about experience i talk about disney the world s premier experience stager i talk about theme restaurants and experiential retail and boutique hotels and las vegas the experience capital of the world but here when you think about experiences think about thomas dolby and his group playing music think about meaningful places think about drinking wine about a journey to the clock of the long now those are all experiences think about ted itself,False,False,good,,,,,,
those are all experiences think about ted itself the experience capital in the world of conferences all of these are experiences now over the last several years i spent a lot of time in europe and particularly in the netherlands and whenever i talk about the experience economy there im always greeted at the end with one particular question almost invariably and the question isnt really so much a question as an accusation and the dutch when they usually put it it always starts with the same two words you know the words i mean you americans they say you americans,False,False,good,,,,,,
today id like to talk with you about something that should be a totally uncontroversial topic but unfortunately it is become incredibly controversial this year if you think about it over a billion couples will have sex with one another couples like this one and this one and this one and yes even this one,True,True,good,,,,,,

now if i take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one of a second which is several ill create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide and that packet of photons that bullet will travel at the speed of light and again a million times faster than an ordinary bullet now if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle how will those photons shatter into this bottle how does light look in slow motion light in slow motion billion x slow now the whole event now remember the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond that is how much time it takes for light to travel but im slowing down in this video by a factor of billion so you can see the light in motion,True,True,good,,,,,,
i thought this is how nature paints a photo one frame at a time but of course our eye sees an integral composite but if you look at this tomato one more time you will notice as the light washes over the tomato it continues to glow it doesnt become dark why is that because the tomato is actually ripe and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato and it comes out after several of a second so in the future when this camera is in your camera phone you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it,True,True,good,,,,,,
inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple and exposure just a millionth of a second but now years later we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million or a billion but one trillion frames per second i present to you a new type of photography photography a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion and with that we can create cameras that can look around corners beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an x ray and really challenge what we mean by a camera now if i take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one of a second which is several ill create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide and that packet of photons that bullet will travel at the speed of light and again a million times faster than an ordinary bullet,False,False,good,,,,,,
and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways so superman can fly some other heroes can become invisible but what about a new power for a future superhero to see around corners the idea is that we could shine some light on the door it is going to bounce go inside the room some of that is going to reflect back on the door and then back to the camera and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light and it is not science fiction we have actually built it on the left you see our camera,False,False,good,,,,,,
now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road but in the future we could create cars that avoid collisions with what is around the bend or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows or we can build that can see deep inside the body around and also for but of course because of tissue and blood this is quite challenging so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems now like doc edgerton a scientist himself science became art an art of ultra fast photography and i realized that all the gigabytes of data that were collecting every time are not just for scientific imaging,False,False,good,,,,,,
i was raised by lesbians in the mountains and i sort of came like a forest to new york city a while back,True,True,good,,,,,,

each one is an archive of our culture through our ripped up media and matter whether it is encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines but each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human and they travel in groups of or at a time theyre like cells they come together they divide,False,False,good,,,,,,
but each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human and they travel in groups of or at a time theyre like cells they come together they divide and you kind of walk through them it is taking me years each one is basically a microscope slide with a human stuck inside this one has a little cave in his chest that is his head there is the chest you can kind of see the beginning im going to go down the body for you there is a waterfall coming out of his chest covering his penis or not penis or whatever it is a kind of androgynous thing ill take you quickly through these works because i cant explain them for too long,False,False,good,,,,,,
i was born with bilateral retinoblastoma retinal cancer my right eye was removed at seven months of age i was months when they removed my left eye the first thing i did upon awakening from that last surgery was to climb out of my crib and begin wandering around the intensive care nursery probably looking for the one who did this to me,True,True,good,,,,,,
now moving forward how do i manage today the world is a much larger nursery fortunately i have my trusty long cane longer than the canes used by most blind people i call it my freedom staff it will keep me for example from making an undignified departure from the stage,True,True,good,,,,,,
now someone somewhere must think that is remarkable or i wouldnt be up here but let us consider this for a moment everyone out there who faces or who has ever faced a challenge raise your hands whoosh okay lots of hands going up a moment let me do a head count this will take a while,True,False,bad,,,,,,
keep them up i have an idea those of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges put your hands down okay anyone with your hands still up has challenges of your own,True,True,good,,,,,,
so we all face challenges and we all face the dark unknown which is endemic to most challenges which is what most of us fear okay but we all have brains that allow us that activate to allow us to navigate the journey through these challenges okay case in point i came up here and they wouldnt tell me where the lectern was so you cant trust those ted folks find it yourself they said so and the feedback for the p,True,True,good,,,,,,
so if youd all close your eyes for just a moment okay and youre going to learn a bit of flash sonar im going to make a sound im going to hold this panel in front of me but im not going to move it just listen to the sound for a moment okay nothing very interesting now listen to what happens to that same exact sound when i move the panel you do not know the power of the dark side,True,True,good,,,,,,
daniel kish good excellent open your eyes all right so just a few centimeters you would notice the difference youve experienced sonar youd all make great blind people,True,True,good,,,,,,
i dont care to set a new precedent but beyond that many of you may have heard me clicking as i came onto the stage with my tongue those are flashes of sound that go out and reflect from surfaces all around me just like a sonar and return to me with patterns with pieces of information much as light does for you and my brain thanks to my parents has been activated to form images in my visual cortex which we now call the imaging system from those patterns of information much as your brain does i call this process flash sonar,False,False,good,,,,,,
im going to hold this panel in front of me but im not going to move it,False,False,good,,,,,,
yes that is amazing,False,False,good,,,,,,
and it comprises of scientists and computer scientists and researchers but also artists like me architects designers writers activists you name it it is a very interesting eclectic membership just a few examples an artist who paints with fluorescent a collaborative team who are combining biological and electronic design with printing technologies in a workshop another artist who is using the slime mold as a way of engaging a community to map their area here the slime mold is being used directly as a biological tool but metaphorically as a symbol for ways of talking about social cohesion communication and cooperation other public engagement activities i run lots of slime mold workshops a creative way of engaging with the organism so people are invited to come and learn about what amazing things it can do and they design their own petri dish experiment an environment for the slime mold to navigate so they can test its properties everybody takes home a new pet and is invited to post their results on the slime mould collective and the collective has enabled me to form collaborations with a whole array of interesting people ive been working with filmmakers on a feature length slime mold documentary and i stress feature length which is in the final stages of edit and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon,True,True,good,,,,,,
in its natural habitat you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands eating rotting vegetation but you might equally find it in research laboratories classrooms and even artists studios,False,False,good,,,,,,
other good thing about watching ted talks when you see a really good one you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker was your best friend dont you like just for a day they seem like a nice person youd take a bike ride maybe share an ice cream youd certainly learn a lot and every now and then theyd chide you when they got frustrated that you couldnt really keep up with half of the technical things theyre banging on about all the time but then theyd remember that youre but a mere human of ordinary mortal intelligence that didnt finish university and theyd kind of forgive you and pet you like the dog,True,True,good,,,,,,

process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change on site i take thousands of photographs back in the studio i work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs to create very large scale compositions sometimes over feet wide i draw with soft pastel which is dry like charcoal but colors i consider my work drawings but others call them painting i cringe though when im referred to as a finger painter,True,True,good,,,,,,
but i dont use any tools and i have always used my fingers and palms to manipulate the pigment on the paper drawing is a form of meditation for me it quiets my mind i dont perceive what im drawing as ice or water instead the image is stripped down to its most basic form of color and shape once the piece is complete i can finally experience the composition as a whole as an iceberg floating through glassy water or a wave cresting with foam on average a piece this size takes me about as you can see seconds,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i consider it my life s mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work ive traveled north to the arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt and south to the equator to document the subsequent rising seas most recently i visited the icy coast of greenland and the low lying islands of the maldives connecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered parts of our planet my drawings explore moments of transition turbulence and tranquility in the landscape allowing viewers to emotionally connect with a place you might never have the chance to visit i choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation if you can experience the of these landscapes perhaps youll be inspired to protect and preserve them,False,False,good,,,,,,
really more like hours hours for something that size but ive been drawing ever since i could hold a crayon really my mom was an artist and growing up we always had art supplies all over the house my mother s love of photography propelled her to the most remote regions of the earth and my family and i were fortunate enough to join and support her on these adventures we rode camels in northern africa and on dog sleds near the north pole,False,False,good,,,,,,
little wonder then that it is a natural place to go for anybody with something to hide and that something of course need not be illegal on the dark net you will find whistle blower sites the new yorker you will find political activism you will find libraries of pirated books but youll also find the drugs markets illegal pornography commercial hacking services and much more besides now the dark net is one of the most interesting exciting places anywhere on the net and the reason is because although innovation of course takes place in big businesses takes place in world class universities it also takes place in the fringes because those on the fringes the pariahs the outcasts theyre often the most creative because they have to be in this part of the internet you will not find a single a single pop up anywhere and that is one of the reasons why i think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon,True,False,bad,,,,,,
not that im suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high quality narcotics but let us say for a moment that you were,True,False,bad,,,,,,
bear with me the first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks every single product thousands of products has a glossy high res image a detailed product description a price there is a proceed to checkout icon there is even most beautifully of all a report this item button,True,True,good,,,,,,
you browse through the site you make your choice you pay with the crypto currency you enter an address preferably not your home address and you wait for your product to arrive in the post which it nearly always does and the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption that is important something far simpler than that it s the user reviews,True,True,good,,,,,,
i wrote via the internal emailing system that is also encrypted of course im new here do you mind if i buy just one gram of marijuana a couple of hours later i get a reply they always reply hi there thanks for your email starting small is a wise thing to do i would too if i were you,True,True,good,,,,,,
brilliant elegant it works but then they realized there was a problem with because every transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger so if youre clever you can try and work out who is behind them so they came up with a tumbling service hundreds of people send their into one address theyre tumbled and jumbled up and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients but theyre different micro laundering systems,True,False,bad,,,,,,
incredible interested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets check grams the search engine you can even buy some advertising space,True,True,good,,,,,,
are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing yeah one vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that is not being from colombian but guatemalan farmers they even promised to reinvest percent of any profits into local education programs,True,False,bad,,,,,,
prices tend to go down product quality tends to go up and the vendors are attentive theyre polite theyre consumer offering you all manner of special deals one offs buy free delivery to keep you happy i spoke to was offering excellent and consistent marijuana at a reasonable price,False,False,good,,,,,,
i dont know why he had a posh english accent but i assume he did now this kind of consumer attitude is the reason why when i reviewed pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three month period percent of them were five out of five the customer you see is king but what does that mean well on the one hand that means there are more drugs more available more easily to more people and by my reckoning that is not a good thing,False,False,good,,,,,,
but what does that mean well on the one hand that means there are more drugs more available more easily to more people and by my reckoning that is not a good thing but on the other hand if you are going to take drugs you have a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality which is incredibly important if youre taking drugs and you can do so from the comfort of your own home without the risks associated with buying on the streets now as i said youve got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace and the or so sites that are currently in operation by the way they dont always work theyre not always perfect the site that i showed you was shut down months ago but not before it had turned over a billion dollars worth of trade but these markets because of the difficult conditions in which they are operating the inhospitable conditions are always innovating always thinking of ways of getting smarter more decentralized harder to censor and more customer friendly let us take the payment system you dont pay with your credit card of course that would lead directly back to you,False,False,good,,,,,,
so on my item i would send my to a neutral secure third digital wallet the vendor who would see that id sent it would be confident that they could then send the product to me and then when i received it at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction vendor buyer site administrator would have to sign the transaction off with a unique digital signature and then the money would be transferred brilliant elegant,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is easy to forget that because of its short life the internet has actually changed many times over the last years or so it started in the as a military project in the to an academic network co opted by commercial companies in the and then invaded by all of us via social media in the but i think it is going to change again and i think things like the dark net markets creative secure difficult to censor i think that is the future,False,False,good,,,,,,
and the reason it is the future is because were all worried about our privacy surveys consistently show concerns about privacy the more time we spend online the more we worry about them and those surveys show our worries are growing were worried about what happens to our data were worried about who might be watching us since the revelations from edward snowden there is been a huge increase in the number of people using various privacy enhancing tools there are now between two and three million daily users of the tor browser the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate sometimes even mundane,False,False,good,,,,,,
since the revelations from edward snowden there is been a huge increase in the number of people using various privacy enhancing tools there are now between two and three million daily users of the tor browser the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate sometimes even mundane and there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online default encrypted messaging services which is a project which tries to link up the connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world to create a sort of distributed internet that no one really controls now weve had distributed computing before of course we use it for everything from to the search for extraterrestrial life but you add distributed computing and powerful encryption that is very very hard to censor and control another called works on similar principles another called twister and so on and so on,False,False,good,,,,,,
and here s the thing the more of us join the more interesting those sites become and then the more of us join and so on and i think that is what is going to happen in fact it is already happening the dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle blowers it is already going mainstream just recently the musician twin released his album as a dark net site has started a dark net site,False,False,good,,,,,,
just recently the musician twin released his album as a dark net site has started a dark net site a group of london architects have opened a dark net site for people worried about regeneration projects yes the dark net is going mainstream and i predict that fairly soon every social media company every major news outlet and therefore most of you in this audience will be using the dark net too so the internet is about to get more interesting more exciting more innovative more terrible more destructive that is good news if you care about liberty it is good news if you care about freedom it is good news if you care about democracy it s also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then shell call out a math problem so let us say four times four and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is and find the tire with the on it and sit on it so the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins and the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores a greater comfort level with the material especially with the boys that in going outside and playing they arent afraid to take on a double digit multiplication problem and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material so with design for education i think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them so this is mr perry he is the assistant superintendent he came out for one of our teacher training days and won like five rounds of match me in a row and was very proud of himself,True,False,bad,,,,,,
it is a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both so this is bertie county north carolina usa to give you an idea of the where so here s north carolina and if we zoom in bertie county is in the eastern part of the state it is about two hours east driving time from raleigh and it is very flat,False,False,good,,,,,,
all right so i wanted to do something special today i want to debut a new song that ive been working on in the last five or six months and there is few things more thrilling than playing a song for the first time in front of an audience especially when it is half finished,True,True,good,,,,,,
because it gets into all sorts of crazy realms and so this is basically a song about loops but not the kind of loops that i make up here theyre feedback loops and in the audio world that is when the microphone gets too close to its sound source and then it gets in this self destructive loop that creates a very unpleasant sound and im going to demonstrate for you,True,True,good,,,,,,
and ive been thinking about how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms from say the ecological okay there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from it gets ugly so like you cant feed cows their own brains or you get mad cow disease and inbreeding and incest and let us see what is the other one biological there is autoimmune diseases where the body attacks itself a little too and destroys the host or the person and then okay this is where we get to the song kind of bridges the gap to the emotional because although ive used scientific terms in songs it is very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical,False,False,good,,,,,,
so ive been working on this song that mentions these things and then also imagines a person who is been so successful at defending themselves from heartbreak that theyre left to do the deed themselves if that is possible and that is what the song is asking all right,False,False,good,,,,,,
first one is the school extension of course how do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write i started to build a prototype like that the innovation was to build a clay vault so then i jumped on the top like that with my team and it works the community is looking it still works so we can build,True,True,good,,,,,,
the community is very proud we made it and even animals like these donkeys love our buildings,True,True,good,,,,,,
the innovation in this project is to cast mud like you cast concrete how do you cast mud we start making a lot of mortars like you can see and when everything is ready when you know what is the best recipe and the best form you start working with the community and sometimes i can leave they will do it themselves i came to speak to you like that another factor in is rain when the rains come we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain dont confound with christo and jeanne claude it is simply how we protect our walls,True,True,good,,,,,,
but for us the rain is good it brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build we just wait for the rain to go we take the sand we mix it with clay and we keep building that is it the project was always connected to training the people because i just wanted one day when i fall down and die that at least one person from keeps doing this work but you will be surprised im still alive,True,True,good,,,,,,
i was born in a little village called in there was no electricity no access to clean drinking water and no school but my father wanted me to learn how to read and write for this reason i had to leave my family when i was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family in this place i sat in a class like that with more than other kids and for six years in this time it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died today not so much has changed there is still no electricity in my village people still are dying in burkina faso and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem,False,False,good,,,,,,
i had luck i was lucky because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that but i was lucky i had a scholarship i could go to germany to study so now i suppose i dont need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today from my home village in burkina faso to berlin in germany to become an architect is a big big step,False,False,good,,,,,,
when i came home to to bring the good news my people were over the moon but when they realized that i was planning to use clay they were shocked a clay building is not able to stand a rainy season and francis wants us to use it and build a school is this the reason why he spent so much time in europe studying instead of working in the field with us my people build all the time with clay but they dont see any innovation with mud so i had to convince everybody i started to speak with the community and i could convince everybody and we could start to work,False,False,good,,,,,,
the walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from the roof structure is made with cheap steel bars normally hiding inside concrete and the classroom the ceiling is made out of both of them used together in this school there was a simple idea to create comfort in a classroom dont forget it can be degrees in burkina faso so with simple ventilation i wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning,False,False,good,,,,,,
michelle anderson aura rosser hockaday so if we look around again there are about four people still standing and actually im not going to put you on the spot i just say that to encourage transparency so you can be seated,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so those of you who recognized the first group of names know that these were african americans who have been killed by the police over the last two and a half years what you may not know is that the other list is also african americans who have been killed within the last two years only one thing distinguishes the names that you know from the names that you dont know gender so let me first let you know that there is nothing at all distinct about this audience that explains the pattern of recognition that weve just seen ive done this exercise dozens of times around the country ive done it to women s rights organizations,False,False,good,,,,,,
good afternoon my name is i am a photo based artist from russia i started my way around six years ago with ironic self portraits to lay open so many stereotypes about nationalities genders and social issues i am russian i sell drugs guns porno with kids vodka water,True,True,good,,,,,,
this boy is a professional dancer only years old but at secondary school he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality trying to be united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality but this boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted because being different isnt easy especially in russia next portrait interpretation is and this is nikita a security guard from one of the bars in st petersburg he likes to say you wouldnt like me when im angry quoting hulk from the movie but ive never seen him angry he hides his sensitivities and romantic side because in russia among guys that is not cool to be romantic but it is cool to be surrounded with women and look like an aggressive hulk,True,False,bad,,,,,,
i focus on balancing meaningful message aesthetic beauty composition some irony and artifacts today im going to tell you about my project which is named desperate romantics theyre my artifacts or paintings from pre brotherhood england century i took the painting and gifted new contemporary meaning talking about issues which are surrounding me in russia capturing people who are non models but have an interesting story,False,False,good,,,,,,
through the artifacts i bring social issues which surround me in russia into the conversation interesting fact about marriage in russia that most of the old girls are already ready and dream to get married were taught from childhood successful marriage means successful life so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good husband and what about me im years old for russian society im an old maid and hopeless to ever get married,False,False,good,,,,,,
here s a picture of the kids that is sage and and rider now i also happen to be gay being gay and fathering triplets is by far the most socially innovative socially entrepreneurial thing i have ever done,True,True,good,,,,,,
i said that charitable giving is two percent of in the united states that is about billion dollars a year but only about percent of that or billion dollars goes to health and human services causes the rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals and that billion dollars is not nearly enough to tackle these problems but if we could move charitable giving from two percent of up just one step to three percent of by investing in that growth that would be an extra billion dollars a year in contributions and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector now were talking scale now were talking the potential for real change but it is never going to happen by forcing these organizations to lower their horizons to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low our generation does not want its epitaph to read we kept charity overhead low,True,True,good,,,,,,
the real social innovation i want to talk about involves charity i want to talk about how the things weve been taught to think about giving and about charity and about the nonprofit sector are actually undermining the causes we love and our profound yearning to change the world but before i do that i want to ask if we even believe that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play in changing the world a lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies and social business will take care of the rest and i do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward,False,False,good,,,,,,
so in the for profit sector the more value you produce the more money you can make but we dont like nonprofits to use money to people to produce more in social service we have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone would make very much money helping other people interestingly we dont have a visceral reaction to the notion that people would make a lot of money not helping other people you know you want to make million dollars selling violent video games to kids go for it well put you on the cover of wired magazine,False,False,good,,,,,,
well i want our organizations to remain human in fact i want them to become beautiful because as machines take our jobs and do them more efficiently soon the only work left for us humans will be the kind of work that must be done beautifully rather than efficiently to maintain our humanity in the this second machine age we may have no other choice than to create beauty beauty is an elusive concept for the writer it was the promise of happiness for me it is a goal by lionel,True,True,good,,,,,,
and there they openly discussed their personal relationships their own experiences of gender equality with the coworkers and the partners it was eye opening for the participants not only did it allow them to relate to the communities they serve it also broke down invisible barriers and created a lasting bond amongst themselves not a single team member quit in the next four years so this is how you create intimacy no masks or lots of masks,True,True,good,,,,,,
when the food company wanted to translate its new company manifesto into product initiatives it gathered the management team and employees from across different departments seniority levels and regions for a three day strategy retreat and it asked everybody to wear costumes for the entire meeting wigs crazy hats feather boas huge glasses and so on and they left with concrete outcomes and full of enthusiasm and when i asked the woman who had designed this experience why it worked she simply said never underestimate the power of a ridiculous wig,True,True,good,,,,,,
based on the promises of positive psychology we speak of play and and one start up even says that when someone gets fired they have graduated,True,True,good,,,,,,
so bear with me as i am proposing four admittedly very subjective principles that you can use to build a beautiful organization do the unnecessary do the unnecessary a few months ago the and founder of the yogurt company made headlines when he decided to grant stock to all of his employees some called it a stunt others a genuine act of giving back but there is something else that was remarkable about it,False,False,good,,,,,,
some called it a stunt others a genuine act of giving back but there is something else that was remarkable about it it came completely out of the blue there had been no market or stakeholder pressure and employees were so surprised that they burst into tears when they heard the news actions like are beautiful because they catch us off guard they create something out of nothing because theyre completely unnecessary i once worked at a company that was the result of a merger of a large it outsourcing firm and a small design firm we were merging software engineers with creative types and to unify these immensely different cultures we were going to launch a third new brand,False,False,good,,,,,,
i didnt know back then that our decision marked the beginning of the end that these two organizations would never become one and sure enough the merger eventually failed now was it because there werent any orange balloons no of course not but the kill balloons mentality permeated everything else you might not always realize it but when you cut the unnecessary you cut everything leading with beauty means rising above what is merely necessary so do not kill your orange balloons the second principle create intimacy create intimacy studies show that how we feel about our workplace very much depends on the relationships with our coworkers,False,False,good,,,,,,
over the last years one three years ive been part of an exceptional team at in israel and partners around the world for taking this idea this concept surgery from the research lab to clinical use and this is what ill tell you about years for some of you you can empathize with that number for me today on this date it is like a second bar mitzvah experience,True,True,good,,,,,,
on the right hand side you see an ultrasonic transducer so the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom okay when you hear the click this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom okay so everything around it is whole and intact it is just a lesion formed inside so think about this is in your brain we need to reach a target inside the brain we can do it without harming any tissue so this is i think the first kosher hippocratic surgical system,True,True,good,,,,,,
so this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies one is the focused ultrasound and the other one is the vision enabled magnetic resonance imaging so let us first talk about focused ultrasound and i hold in my hand a tissue mimicking phantom it is made out of silicon it is transparent made just for you,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is made out of silicon it is transparent made just for you so you see it is all intact completely transparent ill take you now to the acoustic lab you see the phantom within the aquarium this is a setup i put in a physics lab on the right hand side you see an ultrasonic transducer so the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom okay when you hear the click this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom,False,False,good,,,,,,
why did it fail because the people who were gathering brazil nuts werent the same people who were cutting the forests and the people who made money from brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests we were attacking the wrong driver we needed to be working on beef we needed to be working on lumber we needed to be working on soy things that we were not focused on so let us go back to sudan i often talk to refugees why was it that the west didnt realize that famines are caused by policies and politics not by weather and this farmer said to me one day something that was very profound he said you cant wake a person who is pretending to sleep,True,True,good,,,,,,
i grew up on a small farm in missouri we lived on less than a dollar a day for about years i got a scholarship went to university studied international agriculture studied anthropology and decided i was going to give back i was going to work with small farmers i was going to help alleviate poverty i was going to work on international development and then i took a turn and ended up here,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure so i looked at these five first the idea i used to think that the idea was everything i named my company for how much i worship the aha moment when you first come up with the idea but then over time i came to think that maybe the team the execution adaptability that mattered even more than the idea i never thought id be quoting boxer mike tyson on the ted stage but he once said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face,True,True,good,,,,,,

we know why but one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection relationships james comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship george washington carver says all learning is understanding relationships everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult for years i have watched people teach,False,False,good,,,,,,

it is the relationships so teachers become great actors and great actresses and we come to work when we dont feel like it and were listening to policy that doesnt make sense and we teach anyway we teach anyway because that is what we do,False,False,good,,,,,,
teaching and learning should bring joy how powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks who were not afraid to think and who had a champion every child deserves a champion an adult who will never give up on them who understands the power of connection and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be is this job tough you betcha oh god you betcha but it is not impossible,False,False,good,,,,,,
my mother died in a gynecology complication so i decided to become a gynecology specialist that is why i became a doctor so dr has to explain for me my mother was preparing me when i was a child to become a doctor but i really didnt want to maybe i should become an historian or maybe a reporter i loved it but it didnt work when the war broke out civil war i saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in somalia and help the women and children and i thought maybe i can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist,True,False,bad,,,,,,

now i talked about what happens later but some of these differences emerge at a really shockingly early age in one study children who were growing up in poverty were almost a year behind the richer children on educational tests and that was by the age of just three these types of differences have been found again and again across the generations it means that our early circumstances have a profound influence on the way that the rest of our lives play out and working out why that is is one of the most difficult questions that we face today so there we have it the first lesson for successful life everyone is this choose your parents very carefully,True,True,good,,,,,,
theyre called the british birth cohorts and scientists have gone back and recorded more information on all of these people every few years ever since the amount of information that is now been collected on these people is just completely mind boggling it includes thousands of paper questionnaires and worth of computer data scientists have also built up a huge bank of tissue samples which includes locks of hair nail clippings baby teeth and theyve even collected from some of the births which are now pickled in plastic buckets in a secure storage warehouse this whole project has become unique so no other country in the world is tracking generations of children in quite this detail these are some of the best studied people on the planet and the data has become incredibly valuable for scientists generating well over academic papers and books but today i want to focus on just one finding perhaps the most important discovery to come from this remarkable study and it is also the one that spoke to me personally because it is about how to use science to do the best for our children,False,False,good,,,,,,
together with the kids i also went through a remarkable transformation now i come from a cutthroat world of science and high technology i used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen and before i worked with the kids anything that i did with them or anything that i did with myself was supposed to be perfect ideal optimal but after working with them for some time i discovered the great virtues of empathy and flexibility and being able to start with some vision and if the vision doesnt work well nothing happened all you have to do is play with it change it a little bit and come up with something that does help that does work so right now i feel more like these are my principles and if you dont like them i have others,True,False,bad,,,,,,

were used to talking about stars so i started to wonder well if we start working this way does that mean no more stars so i went and i sat in on the auditions at the royal academy of dramatic art in london and what i saw there really surprised me because the teachers werent looking for individual pyrotechnics they were looking for what happened between the students because that is where the drama is and when i talked to producers of hit albums they said oh sure we have lots of superstars in music it is just they dont last very long it is the outstanding collaborators who enjoy the long careers because bringing out the best in others is how they found the best in themselves and when i went to visit companies that are renowned for their ingenuity and creativity i couldnt even see any superstars because everybody there really mattered and when i reflected on my own career and the extraordinary people ive had the privilege to work with i realized how much more we could give each other if we just stopped trying to be,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but for the past years weve run most organizations and some societies along the model weve thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars the brightest men or occasionally women in the room and giving them all the resources and all the power,False,False,good,,,,,,
ive started and run businesses because invention is a joy and because working alongside brilliant creative people is its own reward and ive never really felt very motivated by pecking orders or by or by superstars but for the past years weve run most organizations and some societies along the model weve thought that success is achieved by picking the superstars the brightest men or occasionally women in the room and giving them all the resources and all the power and the result has been just the same as in william experiment aggression dysfunction and waste if the only way the most productive can be successful is by suppressing the productivity of the rest then we badly need to find a better way to work and a richer way to live so what is it that makes some groups obviously more successful and more productive than others well that is the question a team at mit took to research they brought in hundreds of volunteers they put them into groups and they gave them very hard problems to solve and what happened was exactly what youd expect that some groups were very much more successful than others but what was really interesting was that the high achieving groups were not those where they had one or two people with spectacularly high i,False,False,good,,,,,,
q nor were the most successful groups the ones that had the highest aggregate i q instead they had three characteristics the really successful teams first of all they showed high degrees of social sensitivity to each other this is measured by something called the reading the mind in the eyes test it is broadly considered a test for empathy and the groups that scored highly on this did better secondly the successful groups gave roughly equal time to each other so that no one voice dominated but neither were there any passengers and thirdly the more successful groups had more women in them,False,False,good,,,,,,
the problem was solved in less than a day arup believes that the culture of is central to their success now sounds really anemic but it is absolutely core to successful teams and it outperforms individual intelligence means i dont have to know everything i just have to work among people who are good at getting and giving help at sap they reckon that you can answer any question in minutes,False,False,good,,,,,,
it is this small place and we saw a lot of asian people my mom said all of a sudden panicking you brought us to the wrong place you must take us back to australia yeah it had to be explained to her that there were a lot of asians in australia and we were in the right place so fine it is all good my mom then had this brilliant idea that i should go to a girls school because they were less racist i dont know where she read that publication,True,True,good,,,,,,

im standing there thinking this is very confusing i dont know what is going on the next thing i knew my mom took me into this hut she took my clothes off and then she pinned me down on the floor i struggled and tried to get her off me but i couldnt then the old lady came towards me with a rusty looking knife one of the sharp knives orange looking has never seen water or sunlight before i thought she was going to slaughter me but she didnt she slowly slid down my body and ended up where my vagina is she took hold of what i now know to be my clitoris she took that rusty knife and started cutting away inch by inch,False,False,good,,,,,,
now let us take a step back let us look at the big picture there are people who argue that today s innovation is all about social media and silly games with nowhere near the transformational power of the industrial revolution they say that all the growth enhancing innovations are behind us and every time i hear this i cant help thinking that even back in the stone age there must have been a group of sitting around a fire one day looking very grumpy and looking at another group of rolling a stone wheel up and down a hill and saying to each other yeah this wheel thing cool toy sure but compared to fire it will have no impact the big discoveries are all behind us,True,True,good,,,,,,
so today im here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now over the past years the world has experienced two major waves of innovation first the industrial revolution brought us machines and factories railways electricity air travel and our lives have never been the same then the internet revolution brought us computing power data networks unprecedented access to information and communication and our lives have never been the same,False,False,good,,,,,,
if you land on anything pro family planning you move ahead like mother takes the pill every night very good mother move ahead uncle buys a condom very good uncle move ahead uncle gets drunk doesnt use e back start again,True,True,good,,,,,,
we introduced our first program in and the women who organized it said we only want to lend to women who practice family planning if youre pregnant take care of your pregnancy if youre not pregnant you can take a loan out from us and that was run by them and after years it is still going on it is a part of the village development bank it is not a real bank but it is a fund and we didnt need a big organization to run it it was run by the villagers themselves and you probably hardly see a thai man there it is always women women women women and then we thought wed help america because america s been helping everyone whether they want help or not,True,True,good,,,,,,
we decided to provide vasectomy to all men but in particular american men to the front of the queue right up to the ambassador s residence during his unclear and the hotel gave us the ballroom for it very appropriate room,True,False,bad,,,,,,
of course it must be american cola you get two brands coke and pepsi and then the food is either hamburger or hotdog and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic,True,False,bad,,,,,,
obviously he is had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten and he was very happy it made a lot of news in america and it angered some people also i said dont e over and ill do the whole lot of you,True,True,good,,,,,,
have the companies also realizing that sick staff dont work and dead customers dont buy so they all trained and then we have this captain condom with his harvard going to schools and night spots and they loved him you need a symbol of something in every country every program you need a symbol and this is probably the best thing he is ever done with his,True,True,good,,,,,,
and theyd enjoy it immensely i see them standing around right now everywhere imagine if they had condoms giving out to all sorts of people and then new change we had hair bands clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season,True,True,good,,,,,,
and these were the condoms that we introduced one says weapon of mass protection we found you know somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction but we have found the weapon of mass protection the condom and then it says here with the american flag dont leave home without it but i have some to give out afterward but let me warn you these are thai sized so be very careful,True,True,good,,,,,,
then finally i firmly believe if we want the to work the millennium development goals we need to add family planning to it of course child mortality first and then family planning everyone needs family planning service it is underutilized so we have now found the weapon of mass protection and we also ask the next olympics to be involved in saving lives and then finally that is our network and these are our thai tulips,True,True,good,,,,,,
we decided to do something about it but we didnt begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program but we began with a family planning program following a very successful maternal child health activity sets of activities so basically no one would accept family planning if their children didnt survive so the first step get to the children get to the mothers and then follow up with family planning,False,False,good,,,,,,
so the first step get to the children get to the mothers and then follow up with family planning not just child mortality alone you need also family planning now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it in my country that was the case in seven children per family tremendous growth at percent there was just no future we needed to reduce the population growth rate so we said let us do it,False,False,good,,,,,,
we needed to reduce the population growth rate so we said let us do it the women said we agree well use pills but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills and we had very very few doctors we didnt take no as an answer we took no as a question we went to the nurses and the midwives who were also women and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill that was wonderful but it covered only percent of the country what do we do for the other percent leave them alone and say well theyre not medical personnel no we decided to do a bit more,False,False,good,,,,,,
do we do for the other percent leave them alone and say well theyre not medical personnel no we decided to do a bit more so we went to the ordinary people that you saw actually below that yellow sign i wish they hadnt wiped that because there was coca cola there we were so much bigger than coca cola in those days and no difference the people they chose were the people we chose they were well known in the community they knew that customers were always right and they were terrific and they practiced their family planning themselves so they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country in every village of the country so there we are,False,False,good,,,,,,
they were well known in the community they knew that customers were always right and they were terrific and they practiced their family planning themselves so they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country in every village of the country so there we are we went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution wherever there were people and you can see boats with the women selling things here s the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives wherever you find people youll find contraceptives in thailand and then we decided why not get to religion because in the the catholic church was pretty strong and thai people were buddhist we went to them and they said look could you help us im there the one in blue not the yellow holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family and this picture was sent throughout the country so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves,False,False,good,,,,,,
and this picture was sent throughout the country so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves and the women were saying no wonder we have no side effects it is been blessed that was their perception and then we went to teachers you need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place so we went to the teachers over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet a b for birth c for condom i for v for vasectomy,False,False,good,,,,,,
and before long the condom was know as the girl s best friend in thailand for poor people diamonds dont make it so the condom is the girl s best friend we introduced our first program in and the women who organized it said we only want to lend to women who practice family planning if youre pregnant take care of your pregnancy,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i thought well if you cant go to the government go to the military so i went to the military and asked to borrow radio stations they have more than the government and theyve got more guns than the government so i asked them could they help us in our fight against and after i gave them statistics they said yes okay you can use all the radio stations television stations and that is when we went onto the airwaves and then we got a new prime minister soon after that,False,False,good,,,,,,
you can use all the radio stations television stations and that is when we went onto the airwaves and then we got a new prime minister soon after that and he said could you come and join he asked me in because he liked my wife a lot so i said okay he became the chairman of the national aids committee and increased the budget fifty fold every ministry even judges had to be involved in aids education everyone and we said the public institutions religious institutions schools everyone was involved and here every media person had to be trained for and we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money,False,False,good,,,,,,
and i started first with cow achilles tendon where we would take the cow achilles tendon which is type i collagen strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template we would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing cartilage to that in a patient s knee weve now done that procedure and it is been done worldwide in over cases so it is an approved and worldwide accepted way to the and that is great when i can degrade the tissue but what happens for your ligament when i need an intact ligament i cant grind it up in a blender so in that case i have to design and we designed with uri and tom turek an enzyme wash to wash away or strip those with a specific enzyme and we call that a gal stripping technique what we do is humanize the tissue it s by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it and then we can put it back into a patient s knee,True,True,good,,,,,,
so let me just start with my story so i tore my knee joint cartilage playing soccer in college then i went on to tear my the ligament in my knee and then developed an arthritic knee and im sure that many of you in this audience have that same story and by the way i married a woman who has exactly the same story so this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if i couldnt focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me so with that let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what were trying to explain,False,False,good,,,,,,
isnt one two or three words or letters put together it is an idea inside that relates to how we think and how we see each other and how others see us what is our intellect how do you say whether this guy understands or not so if i say freedom sovereignty independence or if your son came up to you and said dad have you lived through the period of the freedom slogan how would you feel if you dont see a problem then id better leave and stop talking in vain the idea is that these expressions remind us of a specific thing i have a friend who is married to a french man i asked her once how things were going she said everything is fine but once i spent a whole night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word for him,True,True,good,,,,,,
he was puzzled by the thought how could anyone be this cruel does she want to commit suicide this is one of the few examples it made us feel that she is unable to tell that word to her husband since he wont understand and he is right not to his way of thinking is different she said to me he listens to with me and one night i tried to translate for him so he can feel what i feel when i listen to the poor woman tried to translate this for him from them i extended my hands and stole you and here s the pickle and because you belong to them i returned my hands and left you,True,True,good,,,,,,

dad explained that this wasnt a big open hole but it was called the an eye to the heavens and there was something about this place i didnt know why that just felt special as we walked to the center of the room i looked up at the heavens through the this was the first church that id been to that provided an unrestricted view between god and man but i wondered what about when it rained dad may have called this an but it was in fact a big hole in the roof i looked down and saw floor drains had been cut into the stone floor as i became more accustomed to the dark i was able to make out details of the floor and the surrounding walls no big deal here just the same statuary stuff that wed seen all over rome in fact it looked like the appian way marble salesman showed up with his sample book showed it to hadrian and hadrian said well take all of it,True,True,good,,,,,,
id seen these before and bucky was friends with my dad it was modern high tech impressive a huge clear span which not coincidentally was exactly its height i loved this place it was really beautiful and unlike anything id ever seen before so i asked my dad when was this built he said about years ago and i said no i mean the roof you see i assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long past war he said it is the original roof that moment changed my life and i can remember it as if it were yesterday for the first time i realized people were smart years ago,True,True,good,,,,,,
good morning when i was a little boy i had an experience that changed my life and is in fact why im here today that one moment profoundly affected how i think about art design and engineering as background i was fortunate enough to grow up in a family of loving and talented artists in one of the world s great cities my dad john ferren who died when i was was an artist by both passion and profession as is my mom rae he was one of the new york school abstract who together with his contemporaries invented american modern art and contributed to moving the american zeitgeist towards modernism in the century,False,False,good,,,,,,
my dad john ferren who died when i was was an artist by both passion and profession as is my mom rae he was one of the new york school abstract who together with his contemporaries invented american modern art and contributed to moving the american zeitgeist towards modernism in the century isnt it remarkable that after thousands of years of people doing mostly representational art that modern art comparatively speaking is about minutes old yet now pervasive as with many other important innovations those radical ideas required no new technology just fresh thinking and a willingness to experiment plus resiliency in the face of near universal criticism and rejection in our home art was everywhere it was like oxygen around us and necessary for life as i watched him paint dad taught me that art was not about being decorative but was a different way of communicating ideas and in fact one that could bridge the worlds of knowledge and insight given this rich artistic environment youd assume that i would have been compelled to go into the family business but no i followed the path of most kids who are genetically programmed to make their parents crazy,False,False,good,,,,,,
with cancer but we dont normally think of cancer as being a contagious disease the tasmanian devil has shown us that not only can cancer be a contagious disease but it can also threaten an entire species with extinction so first of all what is a tasmanian devil many of you might be familiar with the cartoon character the one that spins around and around and around but not many people know that there actually is a real animal called the tasmanian devil and it is the world s largest carnivorous marsupial a marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo the tasmanian devil got its name from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes,True,False,bad,,,,,,
tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger and it uses its powerful jaws and its sharp teeth to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals the tasmanian devil is found only on the island of tasmania which is that small island just to the south of the mainland of australia and despite their ferocious appearance tasmanian devils are actually quite adorable little animals in fact growing up in tasmania it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a tasmanian devil in the wild but the tasmanian devil population has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline and in fact there is concern that the species could go extinct in the wild within to years,False,False,good,,,,,,
begins in when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face at the time this was thought to be a one off animals just like humans sometimes get strange tumors however we now believe that this is the first sighting of a new disease which is now an epidemic spreading through tasmania the disease was first sighted in the northeast of tasmania in and has spread across tasmania like a huge wave now there is only a small part of the population which remains unaffected,False,False,good,,,,,,
and so his dad couldnt necessarily afford to buy all these custom controllers and so with the he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web and a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came and were really excited about that we didnt plan for that at all and then all these professional musicians started using it like at just this weekend jurassic was using this onstage and this d j is just from brooklyn right around here and he put this up last month and i love the carrot on the turntable massive attack most people cannot play them that way,True,True,good,,,,,,
and you know it had a profound effect on me it sounds silly but i thought okay the way the world works can be changed and it can be changed by me in these small ways and my relationship to especially human made objects which someone else said they work like this well i can say they work a different way a little bit and so about years later i didnt realize the full effect of this but i went to costa rica and i stayed with these natives there and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them and they could make beds out of trees and they could i watched this woman for three days i was there she was peeling this palm frond apart these little threads off of it and shed roll the threads together and make little thicker threads like strings and she would weave the strings together and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days the materiality of the way the world works of reality kind of started to unravel in my mind because i realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to maybe a more complicated one but still everything was made that way,False,False,good,,,,,,
so i had to start studying who is it that is making these decisions who is making these things how did they make them what stops us from making them because this is how reality is created so i started right away i was at mit media lab and i was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity,False,False,good,,,,,,
im like wow that is really amazing he doesnt know but he can show you so his hands know and his intuition knows but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be especially when it comes to the human made human built world we think we already know how something works so we cant imagine how it could work we know how it is supposed to work so we cant suppose all the things that could be possible so kids dont have as hard of a time with this and i saw in my own son i gave him this book im a good hippie dad so im like okay youre going to learn to love the moon im going to give you some building blocks and theyre cactus building blocks so it is totally legit,False,False,good,,,,,,
let me give you one example of this you may remember this as the aol time warner merger okay heralded at the time as the largest single deal of all time it may still be for all i know now all of you in this room in one form or other are probably customers of one or both of those organizations that merged just interested did anybody notice anything different as a result of this at all so unless you happened to be a shareholder of one or the other organizations or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no doubt lucrative activity youre actually engaging in a huge piece of activity that meant absolutely bugger all to anybody okay by contrast years of marketing have taught me that if you actually want people to remember you and to appreciate what you do the most potent things are actually very very small this is from virgin atlantic upper class it is the salt and pepper set quite nice in itself theyre little sort of airplane things what is really really sweet is every single person looking at these things has exactly the same mischievous thought which is i reckon i can heist these however you pick them up and underneath actually engraved in the metal are the words stolen from virgin atlantic airways upper class,True,True,good,,,,,,
our own sense of self aggrandizement feels that big important problems need to have big important and most of all expensive solutions attached to them and yet what behavioral economics shows time after time after time is in human behavioral and behavioral change there is a very very strong at work that actually what changes our behavior and what changes our attitude to things is not actually proportionate to the degree of expense entailed or the degree of force that is applied but everything about institutions makes them uncomfortable with that so what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very very large budget and once you have a very very large budget you actually look for expensive things to spend it on what is completely lacking is a class of people who have immense amounts of power but no money at all,True,False,bad,,,,,,
that is the world people actually want in truth we do live in a world that science can understand unfortunately the science is probably closer to being in that in many cases very very small changes can have disproportionately huge effects and equally vast areas of activity enormous mergers can actually accomplish absolutely bugger all but it is very very uncomfortable for us to actually acknowledge that were living in such a world but what im saying is we could just make things a little bit better for ourselves if we looked at it in this very simple four way approach that is actually strategy and im not denying that strategy has a role you know there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot and id be wrong to dis that completely moving over we come of course to consultancy,True,False,bad,,,,,,

president wanted to change this rule he is seen that it is possible to have a different set of rules rules where businesses earn a small profit so they have an incentive to sign up more customers that is the kind of rules that the cellphone company that nelson purchases his telephony from operates under the president has seen how those rules worked well so he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates so he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win win solution help his country and nelson is stuck studying under the the real challenge then is to try to figure out how we can change rules are there some rules we can develop for changing rules i want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical which is that if we can give more choices to people and more choices to leaders who in many countries are also people,True,True,good,,,,,,
if we wanted to build cities for another billion people they would be dots like this wed go from three percent of the arable land to four percent wed dramatically reduce the human footprint on earth by building more cities that people can move to and if these are cities governed by good rules they can be cities where people are safe from crime safe from disease and bad sanitation where people have a chance to get a job they can get basic utilities like electricity their kids can get an education so what will it take to get started building the first charter cities scaling this so we build many more it would help to have a manual,True,True,good,,,,,,

they want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power so if you give just to one side or the other youll have tension or friction but if we can find ways to give more choices to both that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps now nelson also has access to the internet and he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules the ways that rules can keep people in the dark look at the pictures from nasa of the earth at night,False,False,good,,,,,,
but when it comes to images from the black hole were posed with a real conundrum weve never seen a black hole before in that case what is a likely black hole image and what should we assume about the structure of black holes we could try to use images from simulations weve done like the image of the black hole from interstellar but if we did this it could cause some serious problems what would happen if einstein s theories didnt hold wed still want to reconstruct an accurate picture of what was going on if we bake einstein s equations too much into our algorithms well just end up seeing what we expect to see in other words we want to leave the option open for there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy,True,True,good,,,,,,
in the years since then scientists have provided a lot of evidence in support of it but one thing predicted from this theory black holes still have not been directly observed although we have some idea as to what a black hole might look like weve never actually taken a picture of one before however you might be surprised to know that that may soon change we may be seeing our first picture of a black hole in the next couple years getting this first picture will come down to an international team of scientists an earth sized telescope and an algorithm that puts together the final picture although i wont be able to show you a real picture of a black hole today id like to give you a brief glimpse into the effort involved in getting that first picture my name is katie bouman and im a student at mit i do research in a computer science lab that works on making computers see through images and video,False,False,good,,,,,,
there is a big question at the center of life in our democracies today how do we fight terror without destroying democracies without trampling human rights ive spent much of my career working with journalists with with activists with human rights researchers all around the world and ive come to the conclusion that if our democratic societies do not double down on protecting and defending human rights freedom of the press and a free and open internet radical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist ok all done thank you very much no just joking,True,True,good,,,,,,
i actually want to drill down on this a little bit so one of the countries that has been on the of this issue is tunisia which was the only country to come out of the arab spring with a successful democratic revolution five years later theyre struggling with serious terror attacks and rampant isis recruitment and many are calling on their government to do whatever it takes to keep them safe tunisian cartoonist nadia has summed up the situation with this character who says i dont give a damn about human rights i dont give a damn about the revolution,False,False,good,,,,,,

we have a million students a month using the site watching on the order of to videos a day but what were going to talk about in this is how were going to the next level but before i do that i want to talk a little bit about really just how i got started and some of you all might know about five years ago i was an analyst at a hedge fund and i was in boston and i was tutoring my cousins in new orleans remotely and i started putting the first videos up really just as a kind of nice just kind of a supplement for my cousins something that might give them a refresher or something and as soon as i put those first videos up something interesting happened actually a bunch of interesting things happened the first was the feedback from my cousins they told me that they preferred me on than in person,True,True,good,,,,,,
you have this situation where now they can pause and repeat their cousin without feeling like theyre wasting my time if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago they dont have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if theyre bored they can go ahead they can watch at their own time and pace probably the least appreciated aspect of this is the notion that the very first time that youre trying to get your brain around a new concept the very last thing you need is another human being saying do you understand this and that is what was happening with the interaction with my cousins before and now they can just do it in the intimacy of their own room the other thing that happened is i put them on just i saw no reason to make it private so i let other people watch it and then people started stumbling on it and i started getting some comments and some letters and all sorts of feedback from random people around the world these are just a few this is actually from one of the original calculus videos someone wrote it on it was a comment first time i smiled doing a derivative,True,True,good,,,,,,
let us pause here this person did a derivative and then they smiled,True,True,good,,,,,,
in response to that same comment this is on the thread you can go on and look at the comments someone else wrote same thing here i actually got a natural high and a good mood for the entire day since i remember seeing all of this matrix text in class and here im all like know kung fu,True,True,good,,,,,,
but then as the viewership kept growing and kept growing i started getting letters from people and it was starting to become clear that it was more than just a nice this is just an excerpt from one of those letters my year old son has autism and has had a terrible time with math we have tried everything viewed everything bought everything we stumbled on your video on decimals and it got through then we went on to the dreaded fractions again he got it we could not believe it he is so excited and so you can imagine here i was an analyst at a hedge fund it was very strange for me to do something of social value,True,False,bad,,,,,,
but i was excited so i kept going and then a few other things started to dawn on me that not only would it help my cousins right now or these people who were sending letters but that this content will never grow old that it could help their kids or their grandkids if isaac newton had done videos on calculus i wouldnt have to,True,True,good,,,,,,
no we have an awesome team working on it i have to be clear it is not just me anymore im still doing all the videos but we have a rock star team doing the software weve put a bunch of game mechanics in there where you get badges were going to start having leader boards by area you get points it is actually been pretty interesting just the wording of the or how many points you get for doing something we see on a system wide basis like tens of thousands of fifth graders or sixth graders going one direction or another depending what badge you give them,True,True,good,,,,,,
oh yeah most of those were specs by the teachers we made some of those for students so they could see their data but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves and theyre saying hey this is nice but like that focus graph a lot of the teachers said i have a feeling a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic so we made that focus diagram so it is all been teacher driven it is been pretty crazy is this ready for prime time do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out yeah it is ready weve got a million people on the site already so we can handle a few more,True,True,good,,,,,,
national assembly they create the committee of public safety which sounds like a very nice committee notice this is an and it is an alcohol,False,False,good,,,,,,
if they have to review something that they should have learned a couple of weeks ago or maybe a couple of years ago they dont have to be embarrassed and ask their cousin they can just watch those videos if theyre bored they can go ahead,False,False,good,,,,,,
then i started getting letters from teachers and the teachers would write saying weve used your videos to flip the classroom youve given the lectures so now what we do and this could happen in every classroom in america tomorrow what i do is i assign the lectures for homework and what used to be homework i now have the students doing in the classroom,False,False,good,,,,,,
but the paradigm here is well generate as many questions as you need until you get that concept until you get in a row and the khan academy videos are there you get hints the actual steps for that problem if you dont know how to do it the paradigm here seems like a very simple thing in a row you move on but it is fundamentally different than what is happening in classrooms right now in a traditional classroom you have homework lecture homework lecture and then you have a snapshot exam and that exam whether you get a percent an percent a percent or a percent the class moves on to the next topic and even that percent student what was the five percent they didnt know maybe they didnt know what happens when you raise something to the power then you build on that in the next concept,False,False,good,,,,,,

the knowledge map were getting into more advanced arithmetic further down you start getting into pre algebra and early algebra further down you start getting into algebra one algebra two a little bit of and the idea is from this we can actually teach everything well everything that can be taught in this type of a framework so you can imagine and this is what we are working on from this knowledge map you have logic you have computer programming you have grammar you have genetics all based off of that core of if you know this and that now youre ready for this next concept now that can work well for an individual learner and i encourage you to do it with your kids but i also encourage everyone in the audience to do it yourself itll change what happens at the dinner table but what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about,False,False,good,,,,,,
what we want to do is use the natural conclusion of the flipping of the classroom that those early teachers had emailed me about and so what im showing you here this is data from a pilot in the los altos school district where they took two fifth grade classes and two seventh grade classes and completely gutted their old math curriculum these kids arent using textbooks or getting one all lectures theyre doing khan academy that software for roughly half of their math class i want to be clear we dont view this as a complete math education what it does is this is what is happening in los altos it frees up time it is the blocking and tackling making sure you know how to move through a system of equations and it frees up time for the simulations for the games for the mechanics for the robot building for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow and so the paradigm is the teacher walks in every day every kid works at their own pace this is actually a live dashboard from the los altos school district and they look at this dashboard every row is a student,False,False,good,,,,,,
so our paradigm is to arm teachers with as much data as possible data that in any other field is expected in finance marketing manufacturing so the teachers can diagnose what is wrong with the students so they can make their interaction as productive as possible now teachers know exactly what the students have been up to how long theyve spent each day what videos theyve watched when did they pause the videos what did they stop watching what exercises are they using what have they focused on the outer circle shows what exercises they were focused on the inner circle shows the videos theyre focused on the data gets pretty granular so you can see the exact problems the student got right or wrong red is wrong blue is right the question is the first one the student attempted they watched the video over there and you can see eventually they were able to get in a row it s almost like you can see them learning over those last problems,False,False,good,,,,,,
and that always stuck with me all my life why didnt dad say art why wasnt it okay why it became a question my entire life and that is all right because being good at math meant he bought me a computer and some of you remember this computer this was my first computer who had an apple apple users very cool as you remember the apple did nothing at all,True,True,good,,,,,,

you know like that wed go to a computer store and theyd do the same thing and theyd say daddy why doesnt the computer respond to sound and it was really at the time i was wondering why doesnt the computer respond to sound so i made this as a kind of an experiment at the time and then i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much better than myself so i had to hang up my mouse,False,False,good,,,,,,
and then i spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this and i stopped doing it because my students at mit got so much better than myself so i had to hang up my mouse but in i made my last piece it was in black and white monochrome fully monochrome all in integer mathematics it is called tap type write it is paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary it has variations there is a shift ten variations,False,False,good,,,,,,

it isnt about old the dirt new the cloud it is about what is good a combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at you see it in all interesting art today in all interesting businesses today how we combine those two together to make good is very interesting so art makes questions and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions we arent functioning so easily anymore we arent a simple authoritarian regime anymore,False,False,good,,,,,,

i was like oh this my job,False,False,good,,,,,,
you know it is all these one meetings for like four days and it felt kind of like being president actually i was like oh this my job president i do a lot of meetings you know and by the end of the experience i realized why i was doing this it is because leaders what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen and in that room i found so many connections between people across all of london and so leadership connecting people is the great question today whether youre in the hierarchy or the it is a wonderful design challenge and one thing ive been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective let me show you something i havent shown anywhere actually,False,False,good,,,,,,
and one thing ive been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective let me show you something i havent shown anywhere actually so what this is is a kind of a sketch an application sketch i wrote in python you know how there is this is called and the way it works is imagine an organization you know the isnt ever at the top the at the center of the organization there may be different subdivisions in the organization and you might want to look into different areas for instance green are areas doing well red are areas doing poorly,False,False,good,,,,,,
for instance green are areas doing well red are areas doing poorly you know how do you as the leader scan connect make things happen so for instance you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there and know that you know someone in eco over here and these people here are in eco the people you might engage with as people going across the hierarchy and part of the challenge of the is to find connections across areas and so you might look in and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest and it is a person important to engage so you might want to for instance get a heads up display on how youre interacting with them how many coffees do you have how often are you calling them emailing them what is the tenor of their email how is it working out leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the you can also imagine using technology like from luminoso the guys from cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis what is the tenor of your communications so these kind of systems i believe are important theyre targeted social media systems around leaders and i believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design because art and design lets you think like this find different systems like this and ive just begun thinking like this so im glad to share that with you,False,False,good,,,,,,
so what actually works and the answer is rather strange it is a letter we live in a digital world but were fairly analog creatures letters actually work even the top dog himself takes time every day to read letters that are picked out by staff i can tell you that every official that ive ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean so how are you going to write your letter first of all youre going to pick up an analog device a pen i know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it but this is actually critical,True,False,bad,,,,,,

and it ended up being so much fun that i decided i could pursue doing more of these things the next one is i froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in new york city that one was way more difficult than i had expected the one after that i stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for hours i began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads so next i went to london in london i lived in a glass box for days with nothing but water it was for me one of the most difficult things id ever done but it was also the most beautiful there was so many skeptics especially the press in london that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me,True,True,good,,,,,,
he was underneath not breathing for minutes when the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage his core temperature had dropped to degrees as a magician i think everything is possible and i think if something is done by one person it can be done by others i started to think if the boy could survive without breathing for that long there must be a way that i could do it so i met with a top neurosurgeon and i asked him how long is it possible to go without breathing like how long could i go without air and he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk of brain damage so i took that as a challenge basically,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so he came up with this idea of creating a with a scrubber which was basically a tube from home depot with a balloon duct taped to it that he thought we could put inside of me and somehow be able to circulate the air and with this thing in me this is a little hard to watch but this is that attempt so that clearly wasnt going to work,True,False,bad,,,,,,
then i actually started thinking about liquid breathing there is a chemical that is called and it is so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it so i got my hands on that chemical filled the sink up with it and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in which was really impossible it is basically like trying to breathe as a doctor said while having an elephant standing on your chest so that idea disappeared then i started thinking would it be possible to hook up a bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery and then appear to not breathe while they were my blood which was another insane idea obviously then i thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas to actually do it,True,False,bad,,,,,,

the thinner i was the longer i was able to hold my breath and by eating so well and training so hard my resting heart rate dropped to beats per minute which is lower than most olympic athletes in four months of training i was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes i wanted to try holding my breath everywhere i wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if i could slow my heart rate down under duress,True,True,good,,,,,,
i decided that i was going to break the world record live on prime time television the world record was eight minutes and seconds held by tom that guy with the whale lungs i told you about i assumed that i could put a water tank at lincoln center and if i stayed there a week not eating i would get comfortable in that situation and i would slow my metabolism which i was sure would help me hold my breath longer than i had been able to do it i was completely wrong i entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date and i thought everything seemed to be on track two days before my big breath hold attempt for the record the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath and almost drowning is too boring for television,True,True,good,,,,,,
so i had to add handcuffs while holding my breath to escape from this was a critical mistake because of the movement i was wasting oxygen and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions by i started to black out and by seven minutes and seconds they had to pull my body out and bring me back i had failed on every level,True,False,bad,,,,,,
so naturally the only way out of the slump that i could think of was i decided to call oprah,True,True,good,,,,,,
i told her that i wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had this was a different record this was a pure static apnea record that guinness had set the world record at minutes so basically you breathe pure first your body flushing out and you are able to hold much longer i realized that my real competition was the beaver,True,False,bad,,,,,,

you do that you get lightheaded you get tingling and youre really ridding your body of so when you hold your breath it is infinitely easier then i learned that you have to take a huge breath and just hold and relax and never let any air out and just hold and relax through all the pain every morning this is for months i would wake up and the first thing that i would do is i would hold my breath for out of minutes i would hold my breath for minutes so basically what that means is i would purge id breathe really hard for a minute and i would hold immediately after for five and a half minutes then i would breathe again for a minute purging as hard as i can then immediately after that i would hold again for five and a half minutes i would repeat this process eight times in a row,False,False,good,,,,,,
